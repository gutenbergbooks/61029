  <h2 class='c003'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The recent very serious outbreak of Epidemic disease among the
cattle in England may not unreasonably induce the fear that a human
Epidemic is approaching. Cholera has prevailed in Paris and several
other places on the Continent during the late autumn, and it is well
known that the former visitations of that terrible disease in this country
have appeared the year following similar attacks abroad. Moreover,
human epidemics in numerous instances have been preceded or accompanied
by extensive murrain among cattle.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See pp. 7, 65, 110.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Never was a country guided through the perils of an Epidemic with
greater wisdom and energy than Great Britain during the Cholera of
1848–9. The master spirit on that occasion was Dr Southwood Smith.
Long previous to that time this great man had had a more extended
experience of the nature, causes, and treatment of Zymotic diseases than
perhaps any physician before or since. He had made them his special
study, and applied the great powers of his clear, reasoning, and philosophic
mind, to the discovery of their causes, and the best means of arresting
their progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whilst occupying the post of responsibility as the chief medical
adviser of the nation in his capacity of Medical Member of the General
Board of Health, Dr Southwood Smith left behind him a set of official
reports on the subjects of Epidemics, Contagion, and Quarantine, which
will never die.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The reports drawn up by Dr Southwood Smith,” writes Dean Peacock,
“on the proper precautions to be taken to meet the recent outbreaks of
cholera, have been of the most essential service wherever their recommendations
have been followed. If Dr S. Smith, however, had no other
claims on the lasting gratitude of the nation, I would refer to his reports
on quarantine, as quite sufficient to establish them. They have contributed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_IV'>IV</span>more than any other publications on this subject, to dissipate the
gross and mischievous delusions upon which these regulations are founded,
and which are known to be so injurious to the free commercial intercourse
and prosperity of nations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After Dr Southwood Smith left office he gave us a concise summary of
his experience in two masterly lectures, now published, together with
extracts from his official Reports.</p>

<p class='c008'>In times of distress it is only natural to look for the most efficient
help. Our herds only have extensively suffered of late, but we ourselves
may follow, and it is well to be prepared. Even with reference to the
causes and treatment of the Epizootic, the reasonings, facts, and conclusions
again brought forward in the following pages will apply. But
should the worst fears become realized, and an extensive human epidemic
follow, these writings will tell with greater force, and the nation will be
better prepared to meet the danger, for having calmly considered beforehand
the probability of its approach.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>One ground of hope that we may escape a visitation of Cholera during
the coming summer, may be afforded by the remarkably tempestuous
weather which prevailed in December and January last.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c005'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The loss of
the steam-ship “London,” which foundered in the Bay of Biscay, with 226
souls, on the 11th January, and the still more remarkable fact, that during
the night of the 10th, out of 62 vessels riding at anchor in Torbay,
41 either foundered or were dashed to pieces on the rocks;—these were
terrible calamities, and they were only the most striking examples of the
numerous wrecks and disasters which occurred in the course of the late
most tempestuous season;—but they afford a hope of escape from a worse
peril, viz. nations prostrated by disease and premature death.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some account of the structure and functions of the
human frame, of the action of physical agents on this
wonderful machinery, and of the principles which relate to
Individual, as well as to Public Health, ought to form a
part of elemental education. There is a growing conviction
that the necessity for such knowledge is not restricted
to the physician; that it is essential also to the educator,
the mother, the nurse, and indeed to every one who would
enjoy, together with the due development of his physical,
intellectual, and moral nature, the full term of the boon of
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main causes which shorten and embitter human life,
as far as that unhappy result depends on the disturbance
of health, are within our own control. There is the closest
connection between the knowledge we have acquired of
the physical conditions on which the life and health of
individuals and communities depend, and on our command
over those conditions. Every fact we have learnt respecting
the great laws of nature, on our conformity to which
our very existence depends, has taught us that the circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>which produce excessive sickness and early death
are preventible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The character of Pestilence which gave it its great
power and terror—that it walketh in darkness,—is its character
no longer. Its veil has fallen, and with it its
strength. A clear and steady light now marks its course
from its commencement to its end; and that light places
in equally broad and strong relief its antagonist and conqueror—<span class='sc'>Cleanliness</span>.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The term Epidemic has become a popular one. It is derived
from two Greek words, which signify “upon the
people—prevalent among the people”—diseases which,
at one and the same time, prevail extensively among large
masses of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Recently these diseases have received another name,
which is also becoming familiar—“Zymotic,” from a
Greek word, which signifies to “ferment,” as if the efficient
cause of these diseases, whatever it may be, acts in
the manner of a ferment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Epidemic diseases, though called by a common name,
present great differences in their external characters.
Plague, Yellow Fever, Cholera, Small-Pox, Typhus, Scarlet
Fever, Influenza, present characters so definite and
special, that they have been naturally regarded as distinct
diseases, and they really are so different as to render it
desirable, for many reasons, that each should be discriminated
and denoted by its proper name. Amidst this great
diversity in form, however, they present very striking
resemblances, of which the following are generally recognized:—</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Epidemics resemble each other in being all fevers.
They all exhibit that particular assemblage of symptoms
which from time immemorial it has been agreed to denote
by the term Fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>This is as true of the great Epidemics of former times
as of those which prevail in our own.</p>

<p class='c008'>The so-called Black Death of the 14th century was a
fever—an aggravated form of the Oriental or Bubo-Plague;
in which there occurred, in addition to the ordinary
symptoms of that dreadful disease, effusions of black
blood, forming black spots on the arms, face, and chest.
From this circumstance it derived its name. These
effusions on the external surface of the body were accompanied
by profuse and mortal discharges from the internal
organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Oriental Plague, the great devastator of Europe in
former times, and still the scourge of some portions of it,
is a fever characterized by specific glandular inflammation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sweating Sickness of the 15th and 16th centuries
was a fever, with symptoms of acute rheumatism, attended
with a fœtid perspiration which poured from the body in
streams. “Suddenly,” says Hollingshed, “a deadly burning
sweat assailed their bodies and distempered their
blood, and all, as soon as the sweat took them, yielded the
ghost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Cholera of modern times is a fever, which appears
in its true character when the first stroke of the disease
does not prove fatal, and time is allowed for the full development
of its successive stages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common Epidemics of the day—Ordinary as distinguished
from Extraordinary Epidemics—typhus, scarlet
fever, small-pox, measles,—are so universally recognized
as fevers that the popular notion of fever is derived from
the external characters which these maladies present.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Epidemics resemble each other in the extent of their
range. Ordinary diseases attack single individuals, and if,
from season or other causes, several cases occur simultaneously,
they are still isolated and scattered. They
never prevail at the same time among several members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>a family, or among the inhabitants generally of a court,
street, or town. Epidemics, on the contrary, derive their
name from their attacking large numbers at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great Epidemics of all ages have been strikingly
characterized by their wide-spread course. The Black
Death extended from China to Greenland, and desolated
in its course Asia, Europe, and Africa.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bubo-Plague of the middle ages often extended beyond
its proper seat. In the 15th century it spread
seventeen times over different European countries, and extended
to the most distant northern nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sweating Sickness prevailed simultaneously or in
rapid succession over England, France, Germany, Prussia,
Poland, Russia, Norway, and Sweden. “It extended,”
say the chronicles of the day, “like a violent conflagration
which spread in all directions; yet the flames did not
issue from one focus, but rose up everywhere as if self-ignited.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Influenza of the middle ages took a range which may
be said to have been universal. In our own day we have
seen the same disease attack almost every family, in nearly
every city, town, and village; spread within a short period
over the whole of Europe, and then extend through the
vast continent of the New World.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cholera traverses the earth in zones, spreads with equal
facility through tropical and polar regions, and attacks
alike the seats of civilization and the huts of the slave and
the savage.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Epidemics resemble each other in the rapidity of
their course. Sometimes, indeed, they begin slowly, advance
haltingly, and gather strength in silence. For some
time they give so little indication of their power that the
apprehension of their presence is very constantly regarded
as a “false alarm.” Now and then, here and there, they
strike a sudden and mortal blow; but it is only an individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>that falls. After a considerable interval, perhaps at
a great distance, another blow is struck; and then one by
one, another and another, until at last the fact becomes too
manifest to be doubted or denied, that two victims have
been seized in one family—several in the same street—three
or four on the same day, in distant parts of the
town, or in the adjoining town, or it may be in towns
separated from each other by the distance of hundreds of
miles. At length the terror-stricken nation, startled from
its fondly cherished security, sees no place safe from the
Plague. When, however, the causes are intense, it may
break forth quite suddenly, and spread with astonishing
rapidity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1831, when Cholera first appeared in Cairo, it extended
within the space of five days over the whole of
Lower Egypt, desolating simultaneously all the towns and
villages of the Delta.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1832 it leaped at one bound from London to Paris,
and when once there, spread in five days over thirty-five
out of forty-eight quarters of the city.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Influenza broke out in London in 1847, it spread
in one day over every part of the metropolis, and upwards
of 500,000 persons suffered from the malady.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Epidemics resemble each other in giving distinct and
unmistakeable warnings of their approach. These warnings
consist of two events: first, the sudden outbreak and
general spread of some milder epidemic; and, secondly,
the transformation of ordinary diseases into diseases of a
new type, more or less resembling the character of the
extraordinary disease at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a very singular fact that both in the middle ages,
and in modern times, the lesser Epidemic which has
generally preceded and pre-announced the coming of the
greater, is Influenza.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of European Epidemics from the 14th century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>downwards, shows that whenever a new Plague was
at hand, destined to become truly European, it was
preceded by a sudden outbreak of Influenza, as general as
it was violent. This is exemplified with singular uniformity
in the Epidemics of the 16th century—the severest
epidemic period on record. It is most remarkable that in
our own day the first visitation of Epidemic Cholera was
preceded by an outbreak of Influenza which resembled, in
the most minute particulars, the violent and universal
Influenza that ushered in the mortal Sweating Sickness
Epidemic of 1517.</p>

<p class='c008'>So again, on the second visitation of Cholera, in 1848,
it was preceded, as we have just seen, by the universal
Influenza of 1847.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c005'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It may be remarked that for some time prior to the Cattle Plague in the
autumn of 1865, the disease called <i>pleuro-pneumonia</i> had extensively prevailed
among the herds throughout the country. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The second circumstance, and a most instructive one it
is, premonitory of the advent of a great Epidemic, is a
general transformation of the type of ordinary diseases into
the characteristic type of the approaching pestilence.
Sydenham gives a graphic description of such a transformation
in the character of the fevers and inflammatory
diseases prevailing in London some months before the
outbreak of the Great Plague. He states that this change
consisted in an approximation, in several striking features,
of the general type of disease, to the distinguishing characters
of the Pestilence which had not yet appeared, but
was close at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1831, in the wards of the London Fever Hospital, I
observed and recorded a precisely similar change in the
general type of the fevers in London, six months before
the first visitation of Cholera. Anterior to that period,
fever in London, for a long series of years, had been essentially
an acute, inflammatory disease, for which bloodletting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and other depleting remedies were indispensable.
At this period it ceased to be an inflammatory disease; it
became a disease of debility, in which no one could think
of bleeding; and so closely did the prevailing fever now
put on the general character of the approaching plague,
which was as yet six months distant, that the fever into
which those Cholera patients fell, who were not killed by
the first stroke—the consecutive fever, as it was afterwards
called—could not be distinguished from the primary fever
in the wards of the Hospital when Cholera was at its
height, which had appeared there for the first time six
months previously, and which has never disappeared
since.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c005'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was written in November, 1855.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is further very remarkable that the Professors of
Veterinary Medicine and Surgery in London noted at the
same time a similar change in the type of the diseases of
the lower animals—horses, cows, sheep, and all domestic
creatures;—a change requiring a similar modification of
the remedies which they had been in the habit of using.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. A further character of great Epidemics, partly arising
from the last, is this:—they are actually present and in
operation some time before they assume their distinct and
proper form. Sometimes, indeed, the very first cases are
most intense and characteristic, but at others they are
scarcely to be distinguished from the severer attacks of
ordinary disease of a like nature. Hence doubt is sometimes
reasonably entertained of their true character. When
at length increasing numbers leave no doubt of the actual
presence of the dreaded malady, the first announcement of
it is always received with incredulity and sometimes with
resentment; and so it is that Epidemics always take a
country by surprise—burst suddenly on an unprepared
people, who wilfully shut their eyes against the plainest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>evidence, as if they would avert the event by denying its
existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Again, Epidemics resemble each other in the uniformity
of their course. They present, with great regularity,
periods of comparative quiescence and activity—periods
of well-marked increase, culmination, and decrease.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. They further resemble each other in the manner of
their migration. They advance by leaps. On breaking
out in a locality they soon come to their height, decline,
and disappear. Then they attack another locality; here
they pass through precisely the same process as before,
and proceed to a third, fourth, or fifth district, and so on.
Sometimes indeed they localize themselves on the same
spot for a considerable period, and then several places
may be simultaneously affected; but for the most part a
large city may be regarded as a cluster of towns, through
the several districts of which epidemics advance as if
they were proceeding from one town or village to another.
Hence the duration of an epidemic in a place is generally
proportionate to its size. The several localities attacked
being visited in succession, a space of time is required to
spread through the whole of them proportionate to the
magnitude of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Epidemics resemble each other in the periodicity of
their return.</p>

<p class='c008'>On its first visitation (1485) the Sweating Sickness
spread over the whole of England in the course of one year,
when it disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>After an interval of twenty years it broke out a second
time quite suddenly (1505); revisited nearly all the seats
of its former ravages, and again disappeared at the end of
six months.</p>

<p class='c008'>On its third visitation (1517), after an interval of eleven
years, it again finished its course within six months.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its fourth visitation (1528) was repeated after a further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>interval of precisely eleven years. Such was its violence on
this occasion, that the historians of that day designate this
period by the significant name of the “Great Mortality.”
It drove Henry VIII. from London, destroyed several of
the most distinguished persons of the Court, impressed the
nation, from the monarch to the peasant, with an awful
feeling of the uncertainty of life, continued its destructive
course for its accustomed period of six months, and then
again disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this to its fifth and last visitation, twenty-three
years elapsed (from 1528 to 1551.) It then broke out
with unmitigated fury, spread once more over the whole of
England, ceased within six months, and from that period
has never reappeared in any country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Oriental Plague of the middle ages returned with a
like periodicity; and so it does at the present day in the
countries in which it maintains its ancient reign. It recurs
with much regularity about every ten years.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Fever Epidemics of the metropolis return pretty
constantly about every ten or twelve years.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Irish Typhus Epidemics have recurred nearly decennially
for the last 150 years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Epidemic Cholera, on its first visitation, ravaged Great
Britain for a period of fifteen months. It then wholly
ceased; after an interval of sixteen years it again broke
out, and pursued its former course for the same exact
period of fifteen months, and then ceased.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the brief interval of only five years, it last year
(1854) accomplished its third visitation. It now protracted
its stay for a period of seventeen months; coming sooner
and staying longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Again, Epidemics resemble each other in the brevity
of the space that intervenes between the attack and death.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Black Death was often fatal on the first day of the
attack—generally on the third or fourth. In England it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>was sometimes fatal within twelve hours, and frequently
in two days, particularly when spitting of blood or any
other form of hœmorrhage was amongst the early symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The violent inflammatory fever which characterized the
Sweating Sickness, generally ran its course in a few hours;
in severe cases, indeed, the crisis was always over within
a day and night, but it often proved fatal in six hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>In our own day we have witnessed many instances in
which Epidemic Cholera was fatal within twelve hours. I
have known several in which the fatal event followed in
ten hours, the patient having been within an hour of the
dreaded attack in <i>apparent</i> health.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all great epidemics the protraction of the disease beyond
three or four days is a favourable omen. One of the
objects in the treatment of the sick is to gain time. If
Nature’s first violent effort to expel the enemy that has
taken possession of the system, does not destroy life, the
vital powers rally, and the frame often survives the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. Lastly, Epidemics resemble each other in being produced
by the same causes. The whole tenor of experience
shows that whatever produces an especial liability to one
epidemic, produces a similar liability to every other.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Causes of epidemics, as of all other diseases, are
divided into two classes,—the predisposing and the primary.
The predisposing causes are those circumstances which
bring the body into a fit state for the action of the primary.
The primary cause is the agent which directly and immediately
excites the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a number of persons, in an ordinary state of health,
say a hundred, are exposed to the primary cause of any
epidemic—to the poison of Cholera for example—probably
not more than ten would be seized with the disease. Why
do the ninety escape? The poison, by the supposition,
encompasses and acts upon all alike: why do ten only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>suffer? Suppose these same hundred persons took a large
dose of arsenic, or an over-dose of chloroform, not only
would not one in ten escape, but every individual would
certainly perish.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is conceived that the primary cause cannot take effect
unless the system be in a state of susceptibility to its action;
that there is in the body an innate power of resistance
to all noxious agents of this kind, rendering it, when
in full vigour, invulnerable to them; that there are certain
circumstances which weaken or destroy this resisting
power, and which even impart to the body a peculiar susceptibility
to the influence of such agents—and these
circumstances are called predisposing causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The predisposing causes of epidemics may be divided
into two classes—External and Internal. The external
are those which vitiate the atmosphere; the internal are
those which more immediately vitiate the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vitiators of the atmosphere include overcrowding,
filth, putrescent animal and vegetable matters of all kinds,
exhalations from foul cesspools, sewers, rivers, canals,
ditches, marshes, swamps, &amp;c. Causes of this class are
also called <i>localizing</i>, because they favour the generation
and spread of epidemics in the localities in which they
abound.</p>

<p class='c008'>The causes which more immediately act from within are
those which either directly introduce pernicious matters
into the interior of the body, in the shape of foul water or
putrescent food; or which indirectly accumulate noxious
matters within the system, by impairing the action of the
excretory or depurating organs whose office it is to maintain
the blood in a state of purity, by removing out of the
system substances which having served their purpose have
become useless and pernicious.</p>

<p class='c008'>The earnest attention which has been recently directed
to the first class of causes has led to an advancement in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the science of prevention, the importance of which it is
impossible to over-estimate.</p>

<p class='c008'>To give only one illustration of the action of a predisposing
cause, I select as my example, <i>Overcrowding</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Statistical Society of London some time ago appointed
a Committee of its Council to make a house-to-house
examination of the parish of Marylebone, with a
view to ascertain how many families in the parish occupied
a single room as a living and sleeping room. In the course
of this inquiry, one of the examiners came to a house in
which there was one remarkable room. It was occupied
not by one family only, but by five. A separate family
ate, drank, and slept in each of the four corners of this
room; a fifth occupied the centre.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how can you exist,” said the visitor to a poor
woman whom he found in the room (the other inmates
being absent on their several avocations), “how can you
possibly exist?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, indeed, your honour,” she replied, “we did very
well until the gentleman in the middle took in a lodger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I see every day in the wards of the Fever Hospital the
consequence of taking in such lodgers. An epidemic
shows it not more truly, but more strikingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the walls of an establishment for pauper children
at Tooting, in 1849, there were crowded 1395 children.
Little more than one hundred cubic feet of breathing space
was allowed for each child, 500 being the smallest compatible
with safety. One night Cholera attacked sixty-four
of these children; 300 were attacked in all. Within
a week 180 perished.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Workhouse of Taunton there were 276 inmates.
In some of the rooms the breathing space was not more
than sixty-eight cubic feet. Cholera swept away 60 of
these inhabitants in less than a week.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the County Jail of this same town, the breathing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>space allowed to each prisoner ranges from 819 to 935
cubic feet. Not a single case of cholera, nor even of
diarrhœa, occurred among the prisoners in this jail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The town’s people also escaped, while in the overcrowded
workhouses, 22 per cent. of the total number of the inhabitants
were swept away.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the village of East Farleigh, near Maidstone, 1000 persons
were assembled for hop-picking. They were lodged
in sheds, and had about eighty cubic feet for breathing space:
in a few days diarrhœa became universal among them:
ninety-seven were attacked with cholera, and forty-six died.
In the same village, at the same time, under another employer
who had provided proper accommodation for his
labourers, there was a complete immunity from the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c008'>I could add cases of the like kind without number. I
could show that animals are affected by this cause of disease
no less than men; that horses overcrowded in stables die
of glanders; dogs in overcrowded kennels die of distemper;
sheep overcrowded in ships, even during a short passage
from one country to another, die in great numbers of febrile
diseases:<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c005'><sup>[5]</sup></a> results which prove the operation of a general
law of nature. I could adduce equally decisive examples
of the action of each of the principal external predisposing
causes just enumerated.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been often said that we cannot tell the difference
between the air of the mountain-side and that of the
crowded hospitals and fever-nests of towns. If it were so,
it would be sufficient to say, Life is a more delicate test
than Chemistry. But it is not so. The impurities in these
pernicious places can be detected by chemical analysis,
and examined as readily as the constituents of the atmosphere
itself.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been alleged that the Cattle Plague owed its existence to these
among perhaps other kindred causes, and human Epidemics have frequently been
preceded or accompanied by a murrain among Cattle. See p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>, and Boa Vista
fever, <i>pot.</i> [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The moisture in the air of a crowded room may be condensed
by ice. It condenses indeed spontaneously on the
walls and windows, and on all surfaces, and may be collected
in sufficient quantity for examination and experiment.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a portion of this deposit be put on a piece of platinum
and burnt, a strong odour of organic substance is given off,
and a quantity of charcoal remains. If the deposit be
allowed to stand for a few days, it forms a solid, thick,
glutinous mass, having a strong odour of animal matter.
If examined by a microscope, it is seen to undergo a
remarkable change. First of all, it is converted into a
vegetable growth, and this is followed by the production
of multitudes of animalcules,—a decisive proof that it must
contain organic matter, otherwise it could not nourish
organic beings.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c005'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See the interesting experiments of Dr Angus Smith, on the Air and Water
of Towns, “Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,”
p. 16, <i>et seq.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At every expiration the lungs pour a portion of organic
matter into the surrounding atmosphere; at every moment
the skin does the same. This matter is the dead portion
of the body, which it is one of the special offices of these
depurating organs to remove out of the living system as
useless and pernicious.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is indeed pernicious, for it is an animal poison, more
concentrated in this than in any other form of excrementitious
matter, since in other excretions the noxious particles,
in their transmission out of the body, are diluted
with other substances, but as they issue from the lungs
and skin, they are in a great degree undiluted. Ventilation
and cleanliness prevent this matter from accumulating,
and render it innoxious. But it collects in large quantities
on the furniture and walls of dirty houses, and is the main
cause of the disagreeable smell of the rooms in which it
abounds. In some instances the walls are coated with it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>It was so in one particular building in which, during a local
epidemic outbreak, twelve persons were attacked with
cholera, and four died.</p>

<p class='c008'>From recent chemical and microscopical examinations
of the air of some crowded and filthy localities in the
metropolis, it appears as a general result, that decomposing
organic matter is always contained in such air,—the never-failing
presence of animalcules testifying its existence, and
their number and size indicating its amount.</p>

<p class='c008'>Imagine the state of the atmosphere in the dormitories
of the Tooting children: in the sixty-eight cubic feet of
breathing space of the inmates of the Taunton Workhouse;
in the eighty cubic feet of the Kentish hop-pickers; in the
four corners and centre of the five-family room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conceive the state of the atmosphere in this room at
night; all the members of the several families, collected;
every breath of external air excluded; the windows, and
perhaps even the chimney, carefully fastened up. This
stagnant and poisoned air, breathed over and over again
by every individual for seven or eight hours continuously;
respiration, the special and admirable apparatus which
nature has constructed for purifying the blood, thus made
the very means of corrupting it. I have known from two
to three cases of typhus produced nightly, for a fortnight
together, in a room of this description, by sleeping in it
for a single night! Can we wonder at the generation of
typhus in such a room in <i>ordinary</i> seasons! Can we
wonder at the spread and the havoc of an epidemic in it
in <i>epidemic</i> seasons?</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>But besides the contamination of the air by external
causes, it is conceived that the atmosphere itself undergoes
natural changes which predispose it to the development
and spread of epidemics. From time immemorial, the
popular belief has been that such changes do take place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and that they manifest themselves by unmistakeable signs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among such signs may be reckoned,—a disturbance of
the regular and ordinary condition of the atmosphere; an
inversion of the seasons—summer in winter, and winter in
summer; long-continued drought succeeded by torrents
of rain, causing rivers to overflow, and the seed to rot in
the earth; cloud, mist, fog, favouring excessive dampness,
under the influence of which spring up inordinate growths
of the lower species of plants, producing mouldiness, and
the blood-spots, and other coloured vegetation that adhere
to houses, and household furniture, and wearing apparel, and
personal ornaments, and the person itself; under which also,
fostered by a steadily elevated temperature, spring into
being and activity, myriads of the lower tribes of animals—locusts,
caterpillars, flies,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c005'><sup>[7]</sup></a> frogs, covering the face of the
earth, and devouring every green thing that the deluge of
rain had left; and, as the sequence of these antecedent conditions,
dearth and famine, closing the long series of the
year’s calamities. Such, in all ages and countries, have
been the recognized portents and precursors of a coming
year of pestilence.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f7'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the autumn following the extraordinary summer of 1865, and in which
the Cattle Plague appeared, there was a very marked preponderance of insect
life as compared with ordinary seasons. It is asserted by Mr Mc Dougall, of
Manchester, that no case of this plague is known to have occurred where his
disinfectant, which arrests decomposition, had been freely applied to and about
the cattle. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And there is truth in this.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is quite certain that such atmospheric changes do take
place, and prepare the way for pestilence. It is quite certain
that there is an epidemic meteorology. This epidemic
condition of the atmosphere is at length coming within the
range of science. The first step towards this result, which
promises to be of the highest practical value, we owe to the
well-devised and patient observations of Mr Glashier, continued
through the three recent Cholera epidemics.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Among other important facts, he has determined that
there is—1. An increased pressure of the atmosphere,
greatest at the worst period of the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. An increased density of the atmosphere, not arising
from an increase of watery vapour; for,</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The quantity of water in the air was 1/20th less than
the average, at the same time that the mean weight of a
cubic foot of air was 2 grains above the average.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. An unusual alternation of heat and cold, yet the heat
predominating to such an extent that in particular localities
it rose as much as from 2° to 8° above the average. These
excesses were most striking at night, particularly in the
parts of London on a level with the Thames, where the
night temperatures ranged from 7°, 8°, 9°, and 10° above
the temperature of the country, and even of the suburban
districts. These temperatures were highest, especially the
night ones, when the mortality was greatest; and the mortality
was greatest where the temperatures were highest.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. A remarkable increase above the average in the temperature
of the water of the Thames. From a long series
of observations it had been found that the normal temperature
of the Thames is 51.7°. During the prevalence of
the epidemic it rose to 60°, 66°, and once to 70°. At this
temperature the “simmering” water must have poured
enormous quantities of vapour into the surrounding atmosphere;
not the pure vapour of water, for that cannot arise
from a river which is the recipient of the foul contents of
all the sewers and cesspools of the metropolis. In some
instances there was an excess of 20° of the temperature of
the water above that of the air. For twenty-eight continuous
nights during the height of the epidemic, the average
excess exceeded 16.5°.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. An unusual prevalence of haze, mist, and fog; the fog
being sometimes so dense that London could not be discerned
from Greenwich.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>7. An extraordinary stillness and stagnation of the air,
both by day and night. Sometimes in the low-lying
districts not a breath could be observed. Even when at
more elevated stations the wind was moving with a force
of 1 lb 7 oz., the pressure was only ¼ lb in the heart of
London.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wind is the ventilator of nature. Artificial ventilation,
as far as it is successful, is an imitation of nature’s process.
It is stated on undoubted authority (Maitland’s
History of London) that for several weeks before the Great
Plague broke out in London, there was an uninterrupted
calm, so that there was not sufficient motion of the air to
stir a vane. Baynard, a contemporary physician, confirms
this fact. The like circumstance is mentioned by Diemerbroeck
in giving an account of the plague at Nimeguen.
At the period when the last plague visited Vienna, according
to Sir Gilbert Blane, there had been no wind for three
months. The terrific outbreak of the cholera at Kurrachee
was preceded for some days by such a stagnation of the
atmosphere that an oppression scarcely to be endured affected
the whole population. It is obvious that calms
must favour the accumulation and concentration of effluvia
from every source from which they arise.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. A general deficiency in the tension of common positive
electricity.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. A deficiency of one fourth of the rain-fall for the year.
During 118 consecutive days there was scarcely any rain,
and not a single drop for 18 days at the period of the
highest mortality.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. A total absence of ozone at all the stations near the
river, while at stations of high elevation it was of general
occurrence.</p>

<p class='c008'>These observations relate particularly to the epidemic of
1854, which was more carefully watched than the two
former; but the results are similar for each.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“The three epidemics,” says Mr Glashier, in summing
up the results of his inquiry, “were attended with a particular
state of atmosphere, characterized by a prevalent
mist, thin in high places, dense in low. During the height
of the epidemic, in all cases, the reading of the barometer
was remarkably high, the atmosphere thick; and in 1849
and 1854 the temperature above its average. A total
absence of rain, and a stillness of air amounting almost to
calm, accompanied the progress of the disease on each occasion.
In places near the river, the night temperatures
were high, with small diurnal range, with a dense torpid
mist and air charged with the many impurities arising from
the exhalations of the Thames, and adjoining marshes; a
deficiency of electricity, and, as shown in 1854, a total
absence of ozone, most probably destroyed by the decomposition
of the organic matter with which the air in these
situations is so strongly charged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In both 1849 and 1854, the first decline of the disease
was marked by a decrease in the readings of the barometer,
and in the temperature of the air and water; the air,
which previously had for a long time continued calm, was
succeeded by a strong S. W. wind, which soon dissipated
the former stagnant and poisonous atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We knew before that such influences were in operation,
but they had not been weighed and measured. We now
know definitely something of an epidemic atmosphere, and
the information obtained is most significant; for it shows
that the several meteorological changes that take place
during the prevalence of an epidemic concur to produce a
heavy, warm, moist, and stagnant atmosphere, with disturbed
electricity: conditions highly favourable to the
decomposition of organic matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the influence of such an atmosphere, over the
moist and warmed surface of every filthy place, over the
entire mass of all accumulations of filth in streets, lanes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>courts, and within and about houses, and over the heated
surface of all foul water, decomposition goes on with the
utmost activity, and the products are poured into the
stagnant air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Against such products the human body has no defence.
The lungs admit whatever is brought to them—poisonous
and salubrious substances alike. They are guarded by
none of those protective contrivances which we see in
some other parts of the body. Whatever is capable of suspension
in the respired air passes with it directly into the
current of the circulation, and when once there, is carried
with astonishing rapidity into the very substance of the
vital organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the quantity of air which the lungs receive, some
conception may be formed of the amount of obnoxious
matter which may be introduced into the system through
these portals.</p>

<p class='c008'>At each inspiration there enter the lungs of an ordinary-sized
person about 20 cubic inches of air. There are 20
respirations in a minute: 400 cubic inches of air must
therefore enter in one minute; 14 cubic feet in one hour,
and 366 cubic feet, or 36 hogsheads, in one day. To meet
this the heart sends into the lungs at each contraction two
ounces of blood; there are 75 pulsations in a minute,
during which 150 ounces are propelled into the lungs; a
quantity which gives 562 pounds in one hour and 24 hogsheads
in 24 hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main purpose for bringing these enormous quantities
of air and blood together, with such velocity, is to
provide for the enormous waste which is caused by the
rapid and unceasing mutation of organic matter. The activity
of an organ is sustained at the expense of the matter
of which it is composed. No thought passes through the
mind, but an equivalent portion of the substance of the
brain is consumed; no nervous current flows along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>nervous conducters, but a corresponding portion of nervous
tissue is used up; no muscular movement, no glandular
secretion, takes place without a proportionate waste of
muscle and of gland. What must be the amount of supply
required to meet this waste, when able-bodied men employed
in their ordinary labour lose from 2 lbs. to 5 lbs. and upwards
of their weight twice a day.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c005'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Some physiologists
of eminence have estimated that in order to supply that
waste, there passes in the course of every 24 hours as
much fluid through the thoracic duct<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c005'><sup>[9]</sup></a> as equals the whole
quantity of blood in the body.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The results of the highly interesting experiments recently
made by Professor Graham on the part taken by the
active agent in all these processes—organic membrane, of
which the organic cell is the type, demonstrates that all
the phenomena known as Endosmose and Exosmose depend
on a chemical action involving the destruction of
organic membrane. In this process chemical action is set
up dependent upon active chemical agents, neutral substances
being inoperative. Out of this chemical action a
new force is induced, the <i>Osmotic</i> force; a purely chemical
being converted into an equivalent mechanical force,
which is made subservient to the essential phenomena of
organic and animal life: a <i>vis motrix</i>, a force which is to
the extra-vascular movements of the body, what the contraction
of the heart is to the vascular.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a frame so constructed, any particles contaminating
the circulating fluid most rapidly pervade and contaminate
every part of the system.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been sometimes imagined that the quantity of
matter suspended in the atmosphere and conveyed into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the system in respired air, must be too minute to exert
any serious influence upon the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>One single puncture of the finger, so small as not to be
visible without the aid of a lens, has introduced into the
system a sufficient quantity of putrid matter to cause
death with the most violent symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few drops of the liquid matter obtained by a condensation
of the air of a foul locality, introduced into the
vein of a dog, is stated to have produced death with the
usual phenomena of typhus fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is certain that on the introduction into the body of
an inappreciable portion of the matter of cow-pox, or of
small-pox, those specific forms of fever are produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>From these and similar facts it is inferred, that when
putrescent or decomposing organic matter is introduced
into the blood it acts as a poison and produces the phenomena
of fever, and that all the predisposing causes of
epidemics act in this way—by overcharging the blood with
the products of decomposing organic matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strictly speaking, however, all that we really know is
this—that where certain conditions exist, epidemics break
out and spread; that where those conditions do not exist,
epidemics do not break out and spread; and that where
those conditions did exist, but have been removed, thereupon
epidemics cease.</p>

<p class='c008'>We call those conditions Causes, Predisposing or Localizing
Causes, but how they act, whether by accumulating
decomposing organic matter in the blood, or in what other
way, we have no certain knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>One further fact however is ascertained, that where any
one of these predisposing causes is present, epidemics
break out and spread just as readily as when all are present
together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where there is overcrowding alone, for example, epidemics
break out and spread. Where there is decomposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>filth alone, epidemics break out and spread; and so of
the whole number. The removal of one of these causes,
therefore, or the removal of two or three of them, will not
suffice for safety; every one must be removed before there
can be safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>This we know; all beyond this is conjecture, but as to
the most probable of these conjectures, some who have
thought on this subject believe that the preponderance of
evidence justifies the conclusion that the predisposing
causes may themselves become efficient causes; that instances
in which they actually do so, are constantly passing
before our eyes; that it is practicable to manufacture fever
and even epidemic fever to any amount by placing a population
under certain known conditions; that it is practicable
to prevent the outbreak of epidemics altogether by placing
the population under certain other conditions;<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c005'><sup>[10]</sup></a> that the
prevalence of the predisposing causes in particular localities,
in certain intensities, is sufficient to produce local
epidemic outbreaks; that the prevalence of such causes in
such intensities, joined to some general conditions of the
atmosphere, such as the meteorological conditions which
have been enumerated, particularly those which favour the
accumulation and concentration of the products of organic
decomposition, are all that is required to engender wide-spread
epidemics. Those who adopt this view contend that
the existence of a primary cause as a distinct and separate
entity is not necessary to account for the phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008'>The more common opinion however is, that joined to the
predisposing causes there must always be present a primary
cause, having a distinct existence, capable of travelling
from one part of the globe to another; capable of
spreading over any space however extended, or of confining
itself to any space however small—a district, a street, a
house, a room.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f10'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Baltimore case, p. 78.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>It is urged that though we are unacquainted with the
physical form or chemical properties of this body, this is
no reason why we should not understand its force as a
special agent in the production of disease, just as we know
the forces of other physical bodies, though not their
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>The existence of such a body being assumed, it is conceived
that it exists not in a gaseous but in a liquid state.
It is supposed that it cannot exist in a gaseous state because
a gas is readily diffused and dissipated; because
when organic matter is reduced to a gaseous state, it has
passed from the organic into the inorganic kingdom, and
there is no evidence that the elementary bodies belonging
to this kingdom are capable of producing any form of
fever; and because there is indubitable evidence that organic
matter in a recent state of putrescence—the more
recent the more potent—is capable of producing the most
deadly forms of fever. From these considerations it is
conjectured that the primary cause, whatever it be, is
some subtle fluid which has not wholly lost its organic
composition, and that it consists of particles of extreme
minuteness, capable of attaching itself to the surfaces of
other bodies, and even of increasing under favourable
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is further thought that this body is not equally diffused
through the atmosphere, but is only partially distributed,
and that this accounts for the local distribution
of epidemics, and for their occasional absence from places
which apparently present all the conditions favourable to
their development.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, the opinion is gaining ground, that this body
acts in the manner of a ferment. It is urged in favour of
this view, that a ferment being an azotized substance in a
state of putrefactive alteration, the body in question must
find, in the decomposing organic compounds with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>impure blood is charged, precisely the materials for taking
on the fermenting process. The advocates for this view
think that the term “<i>zymotic</i>” is not only the appropriate
name of the whole of this class of diseases, but that it also
declares an interesting fact connected with them. Whatever
may be the truth with respect to these points, on
which at present we have no positive knowledge, one thing
is certain, that practically our concern is with the known
causes,—the ascertained conditions. These are palpable,
definite, and capable of complete removal and prevention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Overcrowding, for example, we can prevent; the accumulation
of filth in towns and houses we can prevent; the
supply of light, air, and water, together with the several
other appliances included in the all-comprehensive word
<span class='sc'>Cleanliness</span>, we can secure. To the extent to which it is in
our power to do this, it is in our power to prevent epidemics.</p>

<p class='c008'>The human family have now lived together in communities
more than six thousand years, yet they have not learnt
to make their habitations clean. At last we are beginning
to learn the lesson. When we shall have mastered it, we
shall have conquered epidemics. Our duties, then, and
our hopes in this respect, I shall proceed to show.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The principal constituents of the atmosphere maintain
their equilibrium steadily over the whole surface of the
globe. There is scarcely any difference in the relative
proportion of its oxygen and nitrogen in the torrid zone
and in the arctic regions. Whatever influence the atmosphere
may have on climate must consequently depend on
something adventitious to it and not in anything forming
a part of it. Possibly therefore that something may be,
in some degree, under human control.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main constituents of climate are temperature and
moisture, and these are the climatic conditions that exercise
the greatest influence on epidemics.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Minor but still important conditions are the nature of
the soil, the proportion of land that is cleared and under
cultivation, the extent of forests, lakes, and rivers, the
prevailing winds, the electrical state of the atmosphere,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>The temperature is highest where the sun’s rays are
vertical, or nearly so; where the sky is cloudless; where
the day is longest; and where there is the smallest difference
between the fervid noon-tide heat and the temperature
of the short night.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moisture is greatest where in addition to all the
other sources of humidity there are periodical rains. In
the countries subject to these rains, the entire extent of
the level and low land is often covered a foot deeper with
water than before the rain set in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elevated temperature and excessive moisture are combined
in tropical countries; and they are concentrated in
those parts of the tropics in which there are extensive
forests having an undergrowth of luxuriant vegetation;
in which the tides of the ocean penetrate deeply into the
interior of the land, and mix with the waters of the rivers;
and in which the rivers constantly overflow their banks and
form marshes and swamps.</p>

<p class='c008'>In tropical countries there are tracts such as these that
extend in unbroken continuity hundreds of leagues. The
western coast of Africa (the Bight of Benin) presents an
unbroken area of upwards of 100,000 square miles, consisting
of one vast alluvial and densely-wooded forest,
irrigated by Atlantic tides, and intersected by numerous
rivers and creeks, whose muddy banks are constantly overflowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In describing a tropical forest, Humboldt says, “Under
the bushy, deep, green verdure of trees of stupendous
height and size, there reigns constantly a kind of half daylight,
a sort of obscurity, of which our forests of pines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>oaks, and beech trees afford no example; forming a carpet
of verdure, the dark tint of which augments the splendour
of the aërial light.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With this luxuriance of vegetation is combined a corresponding
abundance of animal life. The earth and air teem
with living creatures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The mould,” observes the same distinguished traveller,
“contains the spoils of innumerable quantities of reptiles,
worms, and insects. Wherever the soil is turned up we
are struck with a mass of organic substances, which by
turns are developed, transformed, and decomposed. Nature
in these climates appear more active, more fruitful,
we might say more prodigal of life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The air is still more alive than the land. Insects fill
the lower strata of the atmosphere to the height of fifteen
or twenty feet, like a condensed vapour. It is estimated
that a cubic foot of air is often peopled by a million of
winged insects, which contain a caustic and venomous
liquid, several species being nearly two lines (1.8) long.</p>

<p class='c008'>When two persons who have their home in these regions
meet in the morning, the first questions they address to
each other are, “How did you find the zancudoes during
the night?” “How are we to-day for the mosquitoes?”
An ancient form of Chinese politeness, showing the ancient
state of that country, was—“Have you been incommoded
in the night by serpents?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears that there are still inhabited places in which
the Chinese compliment on the serpents might be added
to that of the mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Proportionate to this prodigality of organic life is the
amount of organic decomposition, the products of which
are poured into the atmosphere and suspended in the surrounding
vapour and fog,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c005'><sup>[11]</sup></a> to which they give a decided
and often a highly offensive odour.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f11'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See note, p. 16.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“On fixing our eyes on the tops of the trees,” describes
Humboldt, “we discovered streams of vapour wherever a
solar ray penetrated and traversed the dense atmosphere,
exhaling, together with the aromatic odour yielded by the
flowers, the fruit, and even the wood, that peculiar odour
which we perceive in autumn in foggy seasons. It might
be said, that notwithstanding the elevated temperature
the air cannot dissolve the quantity of water exhaled from
the surface of the soil and of the vegetation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At the distance of several miles from the coast,” says
Dr Daniell, in describing the western shores of Africa,
“the peculiar odour arising from swampy exhalations and
the decomposition of vegetable matter is very perceptible,
and sometimes even offensive. The water also is frequently
of a dusky hue, with leaves, branches, and other vegetable
debris floating on the surface, brought down from
the interior by innumerable narrow channels that empty
their turbid streams into the open ocean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is under these climatic conditions that the worst
forms of epidemics are engendered: the most sudden in
their attack, the most rapid in their development, the most
general in their prevalence, and the most mortal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The form of the epidemic prevalent in any particular
district is dependent on the physical characters of the
immediate neighbourhood. Thus intermittents prevail
chiefly in marshy and swampy districts: remittents also
chiefly there, though not exclusively; while in other
localities other forms arise approximating to the continued
type of temperate climates.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the most part these epidemics are strictly endemic,
and are confined to the particular regions in which they
are engendered. They never pass the limit of the equatorial
or tropical zone. Yellow Fever, one of the most
common and destructive of these diseases, is still more
restricted in its range, being confined within a definite line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>determined by temperature. It is incapable of existing
where the average range of the thermometer is greater
than from 76° to 86° of Fahrenheit, or where the temperature
varies more than from 5° to 10° night and day.
Extreme heat and moderate cold immediately stop it;
nay, even the prevalence of a cold wind for a few hours
only.</p>

<p class='c008'>In other instances these epidemics pass beyond the
regions in which they are produced, and sometimes extend
to all the other quarters of the globe. The Black Death,
the range of which we have seen, was engendered in
China; the Cholera of our own day, generated in the delta
of the Ganges, the great source and centre of Indian
epidemics, ravaged that country long before it directed its
course to Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>When these tropical epidemics advance into more temperate
climes, they lay aside nothing of their nature; they
lose but little of their power. Wherever they go they
decimate the populations which they attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>One remarkable peculiarity of some of these epidemics
is, that natives of the region in which they prevail are for
the most part unsusceptible to them. This is true however
only of particular forms of pestilence. Some of them
acknowledge no acclimation. Cholera, for example,
attacks equally natives and new comers. On the other
hand, yellow fever rarely attacks the natives who reside
permanently within its zone. Its chief victims are
strangers who have recently arrived within its sphere,
particularly the inhabitants of northern climates. The
susceptibility to its influence appears to be strictly proportionate
to the degree of northern latitude from which
the stranger has arrived, and the shortness of the interval
that has passed since he left the European for the Equatorial
regions.</p>

<p class='c008'>We see something of the same kind in the wide-spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>epidemics of our own country. During the prevalence of
Cholera it was observed over and over again, that persons
coming directly from the pure air of the country into the
infected part of a town, were seized with the disease. The
explanation is not obvious. It would seem, however, to
be connected with the suddenness of the shock on the
system. Priestley found, that after shutting up a mouse in
a given quantity of air a considerable time, it seemed to
be weak, and to be slowly dying. If at this period he put
a fresh mouse into the same air, it instantly died. It
seems as if the system can bear a pestiferous atmosphere
better when gradually than when suddenly exposed to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>I do not know that I can give a more vivid picture
of a tropical epidemic than that which is afforded by the
outbreak of Cholera in the 86th regiment at Kurrachee in
June, 1846.</p>

<p class='c008'>On this occasion the atmosphere was very peculiar,—damp,
hot, stagnant, and oppressive. Not a breath of air
was stirring. A few isolated cases of cholera had occurred
for some days. The utmost alarm was excited in the
minds of experienced persons, who felt certain that an
epidemic was at hand. Their fears were too fully realized.
On the night of the 15th, upwards of 40 men were seized
with cholera in its severest form; in two days more 256
were attacked, of whom 131 were already dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The floors of the hospital,” says Dr Thom, the
surgeon of the regiment, “were literally strewed with the
livid bodies of men labouring under the pangs of premature
dissolution. Many were brought in with the cold and
clammy damp of death; as if sudden obstruction of every
vital function had taken place, and the fountains of life
had been arrested by an invisible but instantaneous shock.
It was indeed a sight never to be forgotten, to behold
the powerful frames of the finest men of a fine corps,
who had that morning been in apparent good health,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and most of them on the evening parade, as if at once
stricken down, and striving, with the last efforts of gigantic
strength, to resist a death-call that would not be
refused.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In describing a river on the west coast of Africa, Dr
Daniell says—“When I visited it, I found two vessels
moored a short distance from its mouth, one of which
within the space of five months had buried two entire
crews, a solitary person alone surviving. The other, which
had arrived at a much later period, had been similarly
deprived of one-half of its men, and the remainder were in
such a debilitated condition as to be incapable of undertaking
any active or laborious duty. Immediately before,
another vessel had sailed from this port in such a deplorable
state as to be solely dependent on the aid of Kroomen
to perform the voyage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the statistical report of Sir Alexander Tulloch it is
stated, that out of 1658 white troops sent out to military
stations on the western coast of Africa, 1271 perished from
climatic diseases; while of the 387 who remained to be
sent home, 17 died on their passage; 157 were reported
as incapable of further service; and 180 as qualified only
for garrison service; thus leaving only 33 out of 1658 men
who were fit for active service.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we pass out of the torrid zone a remarkable change
takes place in the general character of epidemics. They
lose more and more of their intermittent type, and become
either remittent or continued. The remittent keeps its
hold over the southern part of Europe, and continually
breaks out in the form of Yellow Fever. As we proceed
northward out of the yellow fever zone, that disease
wholly disappears, and typhus and its kindred maladies
take its place; typhus commencing precisely at the point
where yellow fever ends.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is, indeed, one of the ordinary diseases of temperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>climes, and only one, which appears capable of penetrating
within the torrid zone, and of committing greater
ravages there than in lower temperatures, and that is
Small-pox. With this exception, the ordinary epidemics
of temperate climates do not enter the tropics, while, on
the other hand, the ordinary epidemics of the tropics every
now and then decimate the temperate regions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In these our latitudes,” says Dr William Fergusson,
“cold and fatigue, and sorrow and hunger, will generate
fever anywhere; but every region, every climate, will
exhibit its own form of fever. With us it is Typhus; in
the warmer countries of Europe, Remittent; in the upper
Mediterranean, Plague; in the Antilles and Western
Africa, Yellow Fever; this last being restricted to particular
localities, temperatures, and elevation. While
typhus fever goes out when you enter the tropics, it is
there that yellow fever commences; the pure epidemic of
a hot climate that cannot be transported or communicated
upon any other ground. Places, not persons, constitute
the rule of its existence. Places, not persons, comprehend
the whole history, the etiology of the disease. Places, not
persons! Let the emphatic words be dinned into the ears
of the Lords of the Treasury, of Trade and Plantations,
until they acquire the force of a creed, which will save
them hereafter from the absurdity of enforcing a quarantine<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c005'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
in England against an amount of solar heat of
which its climate is insusceptible. Let them further be
repeated in the Schools of Medicine until the Professors
become ashamed of imbuing the minds of the young with
prejudice and false belief, which, should they ever visit
warmer climates, may cause them to be eminently mischievous
in vexing the commerce and deeply and injuriously
agitating the public mind of whatever community may
have received them.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Climate differs not only in different countries but in
different parts of the same country. The climate of the
country is different from that of the city. The climate of
every city, town, and village, differs from that of every
other. The temperature, the moisture, and the other
meteorological conditions of different districts, nay, even
of different streets in the same town, vary to such a degree
as to influence materially their relative salubrity and the
prevalence or absence of particular classes of disease.
These local climatic conditions and their connection with
prevalent diseases, have not as yet received due attention:
when they shall have received it—and they will receive it—a
new light will be shed on local epidemics.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>I pass now to <span class='sc'>Civilization</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have no sufficient knowledge of the state of the
people and of their diseases, in any of the civilized nations
of antiquity, to trace the relation between them. The
authentic history of periods, comparatively near to our
own time, as far as concerns the diseases of the people,
goes scarcely further back than the 14th century. The
first great epidemic, to which I have so often called attention,
occurred in that century, and we have reliable evidence,
both of the phenomena attending this plague and
the condition of the people at that time. I assume this
period therefore as my starting-point.</p>

<p class='c008'>I take a civilized community to be one in which there
exist—</p>

<p class='c008'>1.  A sovereign authority.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  Laws incorruptibly administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  Physical comfort generally diffused.</p>

<p class='c008'>4.  Intellectual development and activity generally diffused.</p>

<p class='c008'>5.  Recognition of the fundamental principles of religion
and morality.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Without the two first, there can be no security for life and
property, both of which must be placed in absolute and
unquestionable safety before a single step can be taken
out of the lowest depth of barbarism. Without the two
last, none of the others can be acquired. These conditions
are therefore the basis of the pyramid of society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking these then as the essential constituents of civilization,
and applying them as a test to Great Britain, we
shall see that at the commencement of the 14th century
England was in a state of barbarism, since every one of
these elements was wanting, although the foundation of
political and social institutions containing the germs of
liberty and progress had been already laid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Practically, however, at that period there was no sovereign
authority, for the king had no sufficient power to
maintain order, to protect the rights and liberties of the
people, or to defend his own throne against armed men
nominally his subjects; while the lord of every feudal
castle exercised a more perfect sovereignty over his vassals
than the so-called monarch over the nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every town was a fortress, and every house in which it
was safe to dwell a castle, the inmates of which, like
people in a garrison, constantly held themselves prepared
to resist attack, from which they were never secure. They
slept with arms at their side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marauders openly encamped on the public roads for the
plunder of the wayfarer, which often ended in his murder.
Few persons ventured to travel alone, and none without
the reasonable apprehension that they might never return
alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarcely a third part of the area of the kingdom was
under cultivation. The remainder consisted of moor,
forest, and fen. Vast tracts were under water during the
greater part of the year, and at other times formed morasses,
marshes, and swamps.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Immediately beyond the walls that encompassed the
towns were large stagnant ditches, which being the nearest
receptacles for refuse, were full of all sorts of decomposing
filth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The streets were narrow, unpaved, undrained, uncleansed,
and unlighted. There was no provision for the
removal of the town refuse. Gutters were formed at the
sides of the streets, as in Bethnal Green and the neglected
parts of all our towns at the present time, into which the
inhabitants threw the refuse of their houses; forming in
dry weather a semi-fluid mass of corrupting animal and
vegetable matter, and in rainy weather black turbid
rivulets which ultimately poured their contents into some
water-course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The houses were mean and squalid, built of wood and
wattles, thatched with straw, without chimneys, the windows
without glass, the floors without boards, the furniture
of the rudest description; the use of linen was
scarcely known; common straw formed the king’s bed.
“The floors,” says Erasmus, writing two centuries later,
“generally are made of nothing but loam, and are strewed
with rushes, which being constantly put on fresh, without
a removal of the old, remain lying there, in some cases for
twenty years; with fish bones, broken victuals, the dregs
of tankards, and impregnated with other filth underneath,
from dogs and men.” Contemporary writers concur in
representing the offensive odour of decaying straw and
rushes as universal in the houses.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no knowledge of the art of collecting, preserving,
and storing fodder. The animals for winter food
were slaughtered in autumn, and their flesh salted or
smoked. It was only during three months of the year,
from Midsummer to Michaelmas, that any fresh animal
food, excepting game and river fish, was tasted even by
the nobles of the land. The common people subsisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>chiefly on salted beef, veal, and pork, the price of which
was one-half less than that of wheat in the time of Henry
VIII.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were no fresh vegetables. As late as the 18th
century salads were sent from Holland for the table of
Queen Caroline. Sir John Pringle, writing in the middle
of the last century, states that his father’s gardener told
him that in the time of his grandfather cabbages were sold
for a crown a-piece. It was not until towards the close
of the 16th century (1585) that the potato was first
brought to England, where it was limited to the garden
for at least a century and a half after it had been planted
by Sir Walter Raleigh in his own garden. It was first
cultivated as a field crop in Scotland so recently as the
year 1752.</p>

<p class='c008'>For many centuries England remained in the condition
of country in which no more subsistence is produced than
is barely sufficient for the necessities of the people. Consequently
every year of scarcity became a year of famine,
and such years, about one in ten, occurred for ages with
great regularity, and often equalled in their terrible results
the worst famines of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a cold climate fuel is nearly as important as food, for
which indeed it is a substitute. A large portion of our
daily food is used up in supporting that internal fire by
which the heat of the human body in every climate, and
under every variety of external temperature, is maintained
at the 98th degree of Fahrenheit. The greater the loss
of heat by cooling, the greater the amount of heat which
the body itself must generate to maintain its temperature
at this elevated point. This demand for additional heat
cannot be supplied without additional quantities of food,
and unless these supplies are afforded, the substance of
the body itself, its very tissues and organs, are consumed;
a process which cannot be continued long without exhaustion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>disease, and death. The phrase “starved by cold”
expresses a more literal fact than is commonly understood.
Unhappily the circumstances which deprive a population
of the means of counteracting cold limit also the supplies
of food at their command, and the pressure of the twofold
privation, want of food and want of fuel, commonly occurs
at the very season when both these indispensable supports
of life are most needed. Some conception may be formed
of the suffering to which our ancestors were exposed from
this cause, from the fact that their prejudice against the
use of coal as an article of fuel was such that a law was
passed rendering it a capital offence to burn it within the
City, and there is a record in the Tower importing that a
person was tried, convicted, and executed for this offence
in the reign of Edward the First. It was not until the
reign of Charles the First that there was a regular supply
of coals to London.</p>

<p class='c008'>The habits of the people increased the force of these
privations. Intemperance was a national vice. Excessive
carousing at home, or days and nights spent in taverns,
was the usual practice among all classes, and the physical
and moral evils resulting from the custom were neither
redeemed nor lessened by the epithet which these habitual
convivialities appear to have conferred upon the nation of
“Merrie England.” Caius, indeed, one of the most celebrated
physicians of the sixteenth century, couples Germany
and the Netherlands with England in this common
reproach. “These three nations,” he says, “destroy more
meats and drynkes without all order, convenient time,
reason, and necessitie, than all other countries under the
son, to the great annoyance of their bodies and wittes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This condition of the country and this mode of life themselves
constitute the most powerful causes of epidemics;
and an extraordinary concurrence and concentration of
these causes are manifested in the combination of the circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>which have been enumerated, namely, in the
malarious state of the greater part of the kingdom, in the
confined space of the towns, in the deficiency and putrescency
of the food, in the inadequacy of the means of
protection from cold, and in the intemperance of the people.
These were the true sources of the malignity and mortality
of the pestilences of that age.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have no reliable evidence of the actual mortality
produced by these terrible diseases; for no physician has
left such an account of the epidemics of which he was an
eye-witness as enables us to determine it, and there was
no Registrar-General to fill up the momentous columns
included in his death-roll. We can therefore only take
the statements of the time as we find them.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the accounts of contemporary writers, the
Black Death swept away, within the space of four years, a
fourth part of the population of Europe. Some towns in
England are stated to have lost two-thirds of their inhabitants,
and it is computed that one-half of the entire population
of the country perished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the Sweating Sickness, Bacon says it “destroyed
infinite persons;” Stowe “a wonderful number;” and
other writers reckon the deaths in the places attacked by
thousands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similar representations are given of the ravages of the
Plague, of the Petechial Fever, and even occasionally of
Intermittent Fever; and the substantial correctness of
these statements is confirmed by entries in parish registers
still extant, which tell the story of the local outbreaks of
those days with graphic and touching simplicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>During some of the worst of these visitations, contemporary
writers concur in stating that the living were insufficient
to bury the dead; business was suspended; the
courts of law were closed; the churches were deserted for
want of a sufficient number of clergy to perform the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>service; and ships were seen driving about on the ocean
and drifting on shore, whose crews had perished to the
last man.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can form no adequate conception of the terror inspired
by these events. We have seen alarm in our own
day, but then it bordered on maniacal despair. It seemed
as if the last judgment had come upon the world, and men
abandoned alike their possessions and their friends. The
rich gave up their treasures and laid them at the foot of
the altars; neighbour abandoned neighbour; parents their
offspring, and brothers their sisters. “If” says one of the
chroniclers, “in a circle of friends any one only by a single
word happened to bring the plague to mind, first one and
then another of the company was seized with a tormenting
anguish; certain that they were attacked with a mortal
sickness, they slunk away home, and there soon yielded up
the ghost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These fearful forms of pestilence were accompanied by
moral epidemics more appalling than the physical. Of
these the two following may serve as examples:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Vast assemblages of men and women formed circles hand
in hand, dancing, leaping, shouting, insensible to external
impressions; some seeing visions and spirits whose
names they shrieked out; others in epileptic convulsions
with foaming at the mouth; all continuing to make the
most violent muscular exertions for hours together, until
they fell to the ground in a state of exhaustion. Lookers-on
were seized with an uncontrollable impulse to join in
these wild revels. Peasants left their ploughs, mechanics
their workshops, servants their masters, boys and girls
their parents, women their domestic duties, and men their
business, thus to spend days and nights; these infatuated
crowds passing furiously through streets, along highways,
over fields, and from town to town. This madness pervaded
the least barbarous countries of Europe for upwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of two centuries, under the name of the “Dancing Mania.”
It was universally attributed to demoniacal possession,
and its cure was attempted by exorcism. It was one expression
and outlet of the violent passions of that time,
imposture and profligacy playing principal parts in this
strange drama.</p>

<p class='c008'>More pernicious than this madness was the mania of
cruelty, an especial manifestation of which was the ferocious
persecution of the Jews, who were put to death by
hundreds and thousands, under the accusation that they
had poisoned the wells. At Basle a number of this nation,
whose European history proves them to have been everywhere
amongst the most inoffensive of the people, were
enclosed in a wooden building and burnt with it. At
Strasburg two thousand were burnt alive. Whoever
showed them compassion and endeavoured to protect them
were put upon the rack and burnt with them. In numerous
instances these unhappy people, driven to despair,
assembled in their own habitations, to which they set fire
and consumed themselves with their families. The noble
and the mean bound themselves by an oath to extirpate
them from the face of the earth by fire and sword.</p>

<p class='c008'>In England this relentless cruelty took particularly the
shape of burning innocent people under the name of
witches; an infatuation which pervaded all classes from
the highest to the lowest, affording a melancholy exemplification
of the close alliance between credulity and
cruelty.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c005'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The number of wretched beings condemned and executed for this imaginary
crime at the Assizes of Suffolk and Essex alone, in the year 1646, amounted
to two hundred. Dr Zachary Gray affirms that he had seen an authentic account
of persons who had so suffered in the whole of England, amounting to
from three to four thousand. So late as the year 1697 seven persons, three
men and four women, were burnt at Paisley for this alleged crime. We seldom
sufficiently consider how near we are to those times of dreadful superstition and
cruelty! How short a period it is since the light of a brighter day dawned
upon us!</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>But in the midst of these terrible disorders, changes
which had been in silent operation during several centuries
began to produce visible results. The independent power
of the nobles had been suppressed; the feuds that raged
between them, filling the country with disorder and bloodshed,
had been put down; the supremacy of the law had
been established; property and life had become more
secure; industry had taken a surprising start; the
practical abolition of serfdom had been to a large extent
effected; and at last came the final breaking up of the
feudal system in the reign of Henry VII. by the passing
of the law authorizing the alienation of land.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the middle of the fifteenth century improvements
in the condition of the people, which had been gradually
effected by these changes, were accelerated by a succession
of events that gave an extraordinary impulse to the
human mind, just aroused from the long and deep sleep of
the middle ages—that dark night which was now passing
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the most memorable of these was the invention
of printing, which the three immortal masters of the art
had now completed (1436–1442), giving untiring and undying
wings to thought;—</p>

<p class='c008'>The diffusion over the West of Europe of the remains of
a former civilization, by the dispersion of the treasures of
classical art, literature, and science, which before Constantinople
fell into the hands of barbarians (1453) had
been confined within the walls of that city;—</p>

<p class='c008'>The cessation of the long and disastrous struggle between
the East and the West, by the expulsion of the Moors
from Spain (1492);—</p>

<p class='c008'>The discovery of the New World;—</p>

<p class='c008'>And lastly, the Reformation, that stupendous work
which with giant strength burst asunder the chain which
consummate skill and supreme power had spent ages in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>forging and riveting: that stupendous work, which was
not merely emancipation from spiritual bondage, but the
re-communication of the long-lost spirit of religion; the
noble men who achieved it being ever, even in their day
of triumph, less intent on demolishing the gorgeous edifice
that had held the mind enthralled, than on erecting a
pure temple in which it might worship with sincerity and
freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time when the foundation was laid for this intellectual
and spiritual renovation was also that of the commencement
of physical improvement. The towns being
no longer fortresses, it became unnecessary to maintain
their fortifications. Walls were thrown down; stagnant
moats were filled up; broader streets were opened; more
convenient houses were erected. Forests were cleared;
marshes and swamps were drained; more land was
brought under cultivation; more vegetable matter was
produced; the art of collecting, storing, and preserving
fodder was discovered. Fresh meat became the food of
the people during a longer period of the year; in the
course of two centuries the length of that period had
doubled, and at last such food was in use the whole
winter. The products of growing art and manufacture
superseded the beds of straw and displaced the floors of
rushes. Famines ceased. There has been no recurrence
of famine in England since the middle of the 15th century
(1448). The proportion of people in the enjoyment of
moderate competence rapidly increased. It is computed
that in the 16th century the number of small freeholders
realizing a clear income of between £60 and £70 a-year
amounted with their families to one-seventh of the whole
population, and that the number of persons who tilled
their own land was greater than the number of those who
farmed the land of others.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c005'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Macaulay’s History, Vol. I. Chap. III.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>In the next century the care of the Public Health became
a recognized and direct object of the Legislature
and the Magistracy. Better regulations were enforced in
the metropolis for the removal of filth, for the construction
and extension of sewers, and for widening, paving,
and lighting the streets. In the middle of this century
the Great Fire (1666) consumed 13,000 houses and left
an open space of upwards of a square mile. This opportunity
of improvement was not lost. Though in rebuilding
the city the same lines of streets were preserved, and
the streets were still kept much too narrow, yet there
was some improvement in the general plan, while the
houses were built of better materials; brick was substituted
for wood and plaster, and the buildings were less
crowded and less projecting.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spirit of improvement thus awakened exerted itself
with increased effect during the whole of the eighteenth
century. Agriculture, which was now rapidly advancing,
had created a demand for town refuse, the fertilizing
property of which began to be perceived; so that all
manner of offensive substances were regularly carried
away to the fields, to the great increase of the cleanliness
of the streets. At the same time many of the narrower
streets were widened, the houses were entirely taken down
and rebuilt, and in this operation slate was universally
substituted for thatch, and brick for timber. The pavement
also, which had long been the reproach of London,
was improved. Population in the mean time rapidly increased,
less by the relative increase of the number of
births than by the proportionate decrease of the deaths,
and this notwithstanding the occasional occurrence of
severe pestilence. The result of the whole was an increase
in the length of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>An increase in the length of life is an expression and a
measure of the sum of comfort experienced from the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>collective circumstances that make up national prosperity.
In the interval between the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries that sum grew into a highly important one. Of
this the proof is positive.</p>

<p class='c008'>It happened that in the year 1693 a loan was raised for
the service of the State by the method of Tontine, and
that another was contracted by the same method in the
year 1790; the interval being almost exactly a century.</p>

<p class='c008'>The term Tontine is derived from the name of the originator
of this scheme of life annuity, the principle of which
is this. The person who advances £100 is at liberty to
name any life he pleases, during the existence of which he
draws a certain annuity; and as the shares of the dead
nominees are distributed among the living ones, the annuity
continually increases till the last survivor gets the
whole income.</p>

<p class='c008'>A comparison of the experience between two Tontines
gives the exact measure of the effect produced on the duration
of life, by such changes in the social condition of
the people as may have occurred in the interval between
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A person of the male sex (for there is a considerable
difference in the results in the two sexes), living in 1793,
compared with a male living in 1690, at fifteen years of
age, had gained an expectation of life of nearly ten years;
at twenty years of age, nine years and a half; at twenty-five
years of age, upwards of eight years; at thirty years
of age, upwards of seven years, and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or the gain in the expectation of life may be stated
more correctly in years, thus: Take for example a man at
the age of 30, in 1693 his expectation of life would
have been 26.665; in 1790 it would have been 33.775
years.</p>

<p class='c008'>On this evidence Mr Finlaison justly observes that
civilization could not have increased by a single leap in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the time of Mr Pitt, but must have been slowly on the
increase at least since the days of Queen Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>We may then fairly conclude, that in the interval between
the close of the 17th and 18th centuries human life
gained an addition equivalent to a fourth part of its whole
term. What has it gained in the succeeding century?
What has been the increase in the value of life in this
first half of the century in which we ourselves have lived?
Though unfortunately we can appeal to the results of no
renewed tontine to enable us to answer this question with
exactness,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c005'><sup>[15]</sup></a> yet there are not wanting evidences that the
value of life continues progressively to increase. It must
necessarily continue to increase, because the main conditions
on which life and health depend have experienced,
during the whole of the present century, an expansion
and improvement, on which no former age presents a
parallel. It will be sufficient to establish this fact, to
glance at what has been effected within this period in the
multiplication and diffusion of the three primary necessaries
of existence—food, clothing, and fuel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such has been the increased production of food during
the present century, that the quantity now raised maintains
ten millions more human beings than existed at its
commencement; for on the first enumeration of the people
in 1801 the population of Great Britain was eleven millions;
in 1851, it was twenty-one millions.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c005'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f15'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Considering that there appears to be no objection in principle to the method
of raising a loan by Tontine, and that the scheme is a popular one, it
seems highly desirable that we should continue this means of measuring with
positive exactness the results of our advancing civilization.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>According to Mr Rickman, from the best information that can be obtained
from Doomsday Book, the population of England in the time of William the
Conqueror was 1½ millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the reign of Edward the Third (1377), when a poll-tax was imposed on
all persons of both sexes above fourteen, it was 2½ millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, at the period of the Spanish Armada, it was
4 millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Mr Finlaison, at the close of the 16th century it was somewhat
under 5 millions two hundred thousand.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Mr Rickman, on a computation founded on the return of Baptisms,
as stated in the Abstract of Parish Registers, it was in 1700, 5½ millions;
in 1750, 6½ millions; and in 1770, 7½ millions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>This increased production of food consists chiefly of
grain, green crops, and garden vegetables, countless in
variety, and highly nutritious and grateful, completely reversing
the nature of the national subsistence compared
with that of former times, and giving to the masses of the
people a constant and unfailing supply, winter and summer,
of fresh vegetable nutriment.</p>

<p class='c008'>This increased production of food is mainly of home
growth, for the supply of wheat from foreign sources
would scarcely suffice to afford to each person two gallons
of flour annually.</p>

<p class='c008'>This increased production has been obtained partly by
a progressive increase in the quantity of land brought
under cultivation, which now amounts for the United
Kingdom to upwards of 40,000,000 of acres, by far the
greater part of which is employed in the production of
human food; and partly by the employment of capital in
the improvement of the soil, by which large tracts that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>few years ago were wholly sterile, or deemed incapable of
producing wheat, now yield some of the finest grain in
England.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c005'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“In 1821 almost the only grain produced in the Fens of Cambridgeshire
consisted of oats; since then, by draining and manuring, the capability of the
soil has been so changed that these fens now produce some of the finest wheat
that is grown in England; and this more costly grain now constitutes the main
dependence of the farmers in a district where 14 years ago its produce was
scarcely attempted.”—<i>Porter’s Progress of the Nation.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This increased fertility of the soil renders it more
healthy by diminishing its moisture and raising its temperature.
One cubic foot of water in the process of evaporation
deprives three millions of cubic feet of air of one degree
of temperature. An undrained field growing rushes has
a permanent temperature from four to six degrees lower
than an adjoining field drained and growing wheat. By
draining and manuring, by throwing down fences, by removing
trees, by clearing underwood, and by promoting
the free aëration of the soil, the temperature of large tracts
of land in the north of England has been permanently
raised three degrees. Thus that very culture of the earth,
by which it is made to yield the largest amount of food,
increases its salubrity as an abode for man, and lessens at
their source the main causes of epidemics.</p>

<p class='c008'>This increased production has been obtained by a proportionally
small addition to labour; for while the quantity
of land brought under cultivation, and its produce, have
been increasing at a rate of which there is no similar example
in any age or country, the relative number of persons
employed in agriculture has been as steadily decreasing.
As long as the labour of a man applied to the
cultivation of the soil is capable of producing only a bare
subsistence for himself, there can be no advance in civilization.
But when two men can produce subsistence for
three, the labour of the third can be set free for the production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of surplus articles, which add to the sum of the
general convenience, and from that moment the community
takes a start in the career of improvement. From a comparison
of occupations taken in 1831, it appears that, at
that time, the division of labour among the people was
such that one person raised nearly all the food of home
production consumed by four persons.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c005'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Were the remaining three idle? Mediately or immediately
they were engaged in producing clothing, or fuel, or
machinery, economizing the production of both; and
busily and well they worked.</p>

<p class='c008'>In number they exceed one million and a half. Taking
into account the accessory occupations, indeed, no fewer
than one million two hundred thousand are employed on
one single material alone, namely cotton. For these workers,
at the beginning of the century, there were imported
yearly 56 millions of pounds of cotton: at present the
annual importation of it exceeds 550 millions of pounds.
These workers in 1820 were assisted in their operations by
fourteen thousand power-looms; at present they are assisted
by three hundred thousand power-looms, besides
twenty-five millions of spindles;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c005'><sup>[19]</sup></a> while each power-loom,
superintended by an adult assisted by a child, completes
weekly twenty times the amount of work which the hand-loom
is capable of producing. The increase of production
is of course enormous, and the effect is a progressive
cheapening of the articles manufactured, reducing the
price of some of them tenfold, and placing them within the
reach of the poorest classes:<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c005'><sup>[20]</sup></a> articles of clothing not
only conducive to health through warmth, but almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>equally so through cleanliness; for they are almost all
composed of such tissues and textures as favour and compel
frequent washing.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The cheapness of some of these ornamental as well as useful fabrics is calculated
to excite astonishment. A yard of platt net is worth from 20s. to £5;
a yard of plain net may be bought for one shilling.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Gigantic strides have been made at the same time in
another article of clothing, the basis of which is wool, and
of which there were imported in 1801 seven millions of
pounds; in 1844, sixty-three millions of pounds. This
enormous importation of foreign wool has not only not diminished
its home growth, but the increased demand for
it has led to a vast multiplication of the animals that yield
it, and what is of equal importance, has induced an extraordinary
care in improving their breed; so that the very
means which have fed the steam-engine have fed the
people both with more plentiful and with better food; the
steam-engine, meanwhile, applied to these and to all manufacturing
processes, being as much a producer of food as
the plough.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c005'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f21'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similar progress has been made in the manufacture of flax and silk as of
cotton and wool.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And the same is emphatically true of fuel, the main
creator of all this activity and of its astonishing results;
this necessary of life being now brought to the door of
every family in three-fold abundance and at one-half the
price at which it could have been obtained at the commencement
of the century; while such is the demand for
it in various manufactures of vast magnitude, that one
trade alone, that of iron, consumes annually eight millions
of tons—a trade which immediately and powerfully facilitates
the production both of food and of clothing. Thus,
like one of Nature’s beautiful adaptations, like that wonderful
cycle, for example, in which production, change, and
reproduction go on in an unvarying circle, the constant
and abundant supply of one main necessary of life furnishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the means of producing the others; while these last are
the immediate causes of the abundance of the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>And what a busy hive does this country present at the
present time! Out of every thousand males twenty years
of age in the kingdom, 836 are directly employed in some
active occupation contributing to the national wealth;
while the remaining 114 are by no means idle, for they are
engaged in some one of the professions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the masses have not yet obtained their due
share of the wealth they create, and though there is a class
which in relation to one essential condition, to be stated
immediately, civilization has scarcely reached, or reached
only to injure—with these exceptions, no doubt very important
ones—the evidence is indubitable that the entire
body of society, from its base to its apex, stands on an
elevated table-land which many centuries have been employed
in raising and consolidating. I have partly proved
this by showing the general diffusion of the means of
healthful subsistence and the prolongation of life. I am
now to prove it by applying these facts to the subject more
especially before us, the decline and disappearance of
epidemics.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now exactly two centuries, short of ten years, since
the visitation of the Great Plague of 1665—that terrible
disease which ravaged England for the space of 1249
years: for it is first heard of in English history in the year
430, and the last year in which its name appears in the
Bills of Mortality is 1679; that terrible disease which not
only maintained undiminished power over this vast space
of time, but which sometimes recurred twenty times in one
century—that terrible disease is gone. It cannot be supposed
that it has worn itself out, for it still frequently
returns with its ancient malignity to Constantinople, Alexandria,
Smyrna, and other Eastern States.</p>

<p class='c008'>Petechial or Jail fever, the fatal scourge of the ship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the prison, the hospital, the school, and in short of
every place in which any considerable number of persons
was assembled, and which when it once broke out was
as destructive as the plague—that terrible disease is gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intermittent fever, which in the middle of the fifteenth
century and long afterwards recurred like the plague
periodically but more frequently, and which often raged as
universally, which was sometimes so mortal that the living
could hardly bury the dead, and which spared not even
the throne, for James I. and Oliver Cromwell both died of
ague contracted in London—that formidable disease is
gone. Ague, it is true, still exists in the fenny and
marshy places which yet remain in England, and we occasionally
see a case contracted there in the wards of the
London Fever Hospital, but I have not seen a single case
of ague contracted in London for upwards of a quarter of
a century.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remittent fever is also gone, scurvy is gone, rickets is
gone, malignant sore throat is gone, typhus-gravior is gone,
and if small-pox is not gone it is entirely the consequence
of our own apathy and folly.</p>

<p class='c008'>No less remarkable is the gradual decline and the ultimate
cessation of certain forms of bowel-complaint of a
very painful nature, the very names of which have long
disappeared both from medical and popular language. In
the 17th century the deaths from two of these diseases
alone registered in the Bills of Mortality under two separate
titles, were never less than 1000 annually, and in
some years they exceeded 4000; but from having been
1070 in the year 1700, they decreased through each successive
decade of that century in the following remarkable
progression: 770, 706, 350, 150, 110, 80, 70, 40, 20; and
they have so entirely disappeared during the 19th century,
that, as I have just said, their very names are no longer
in use.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Moreover several acute diseases which hardly come
under the name of Epidemics, such as Rheumatic Fever,
Pneumonia, and Peripneumonia, are much less frequent
and fatal now than they were a century ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this time there has been a continually decreasing
mortality. In 1700 the estimated mortality of England
and Wales was 1 in 39; in 1750 it was 1 in 40; in 1801
it was 1 in 44; in 1810 it was 1 in 49; in 1820 it was 1
in 55, and in 1830 it was 1 in 58.</p>

<p class='c008'>In London in 1700<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c005'><sup>[22]</sup></a> the deaths were 1 in 25; in 1750,
1 in 21;<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c005'><sup>[23]</sup></a> in 1801, 1 in 35; in 1810, 1 in 38; and in
1830, 1 in 45.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f22'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>parliamentary Returns, 1811.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f23'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is conceived that the remarkable increase of the mortality in the middle
of this century was mainly caused by the abuse of spirituous liquors, which was
checked about that time by the imposition of high duties.—<i>Sir Gilbert Blane’s
Dissertations.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The diminishing number of those who are born merely
to die exhibits the decrease of mortality in a still more
striking point of view. The estimated mortality of persons
under twenty years of age in London in 1780 was 1 in 76;
in 1801 it was 1 in 96; in 1830 it was 1 in 124; in 1833
it was 1 in 137; not much more than one-half the proportion
who died under twenty half a century ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>The contrast between the mortality of former times and
of the present is seen in the mortality of London in 1685
and in 1830. In the first period the deaths were 1 in 23;
in the second they were 1 in 45, little more than one-half.
Truly therefore has it been said, that the salubrity of London
in the nineteenth century and of London in the seventeenth
is far greater than the difference between London
in an ordinary season and London in the cholera.</p>

<p class='c008'>But still we have had Cholera. In less than a quarter
of a century we have had three visitations of this dreadful
disease, which exhibits the essential characters of a pestilence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of the middle ages; and if Typhus-gravior has
disappeared, Typhus and its kindred diseases have taken
its place; and the Registrar-General constantly presents
before our eyes a faithful record of their ravages.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is too true. We still have epidemics—and why?
Because in all our towns there are large portions of the
people who live in a state essentially the same as that
which existed in the middle ages. The conditions are
similar; the results are similar.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is this unhappy class of people that form the exception
to the general progress of the nation to which I have
adverted.</p>

<p class='c008'>These wretched places and their inhabitants do not obtrude
themselves on the public eye. They are not seen in
our common thoroughfares, nor in our splendid streets and
squares. They are not known. The medical man knows
them, the minister of religion knows them, the relieving
officer knows them, a few dispensers of voluntary charity
know them. They are not known to any one else.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me then describe one.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a small room, say twelve feet square; an inner room;
no chimney, no window that will open, no inlet for fresh
air, no outlet for foul air. There, on a miserable bed, lies
a woman ill of typhus fever; a child at her side on the same
bed is dying of that fever; a child already dead of it is
stretched out on a table at the bed-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>I could not breathe the air of that room. I could not
remain in it long enough to write a prescription for the
poor patients. As I was writing it at the street-door I
shivered and felt sick. I knew that I had taken fever. I
passed through a very severe form of it. I could take you
to hundreds of such houses in every part of London; to
hundreds of courts and lanes wholly consisting of such
houses.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such houses, with the conditions of the 15th and 16th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>centuries, Cholera, in the middle of the 19th, found and
exerted a power similar to that which characterized the
epidemics of the middle ages, and here Typhus and its
kindred diseases continually hold their undisputed reign:
houses whose unhealthfulness is increased by the only
marks of the age which attach to them, their brick construction
and their glass windows; those bricks and
windows more effectually than the ancient wattles excluding
the external, and confining the internal air, and thereby
fostering the generation and spread of typhus. It is remarked
by Dr Macculloch, in his account of the Hebrides,
that while the inhabitants had no shelter but huts of the
most simple construction which afforded free ingress and
egress to the air, they were not subject to fevers, but when
such habitations were provided as seemed more comfortable
and commodious, but which afforded recesses for stagnating
air and impurities, then febrile infection was generated.
Houses in this state, without ventilation, without the
means of cleanliness, worse than the huts of the savage,
exist in great numbers in all our towns, and too truly
merit the name they have acquired of “fever nests.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I once took a distinguished statistician of France to some
of these places in London, and showed him the sick with
typhus lying in their wretched beds; for the sick with
typhus may be seen there every day of every year. After
the painful inspection he exclaimed—“England is indeed
adorned with a splendid mantle, but under it are concealed
the greatest horrors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Determined that this eminent person should see both
sides of the picture, I next took him to the Model Dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>What are the Model Dwellings? Small plots of civilization
cultivated in the midst of a wide waste of barbarism.</p>

<p class='c008'>In what does their civilization consist? In very simple
matters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subsoil drainage of the site of the building;</p>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The free admission of light and air to each inhabited
room;</p>
<p class='c018'>The abolition of the cess-pool, involving complete house
drainage, an abundant supply of water, and the immediate
removal by it of all refuse which it is capable of
holding in suspension;</p>
<p class='c018'>Means for the removal of house refuse not capable of suspension
in water.</p>
<p class='c018'>And this is all. And what are the results of these few
and simple arrangements?</p>
<p class='c018'>That the mortality among the inhabitants of these dwellings
is less than that of London generally, and far
less than that of some of the filthy and neglected
localities in London, the Potteries of Kensington for
example; while the mortality among children under
ten years of age, on an average of three years, is one-half
less than that of the nation generally, and four
times less than that of the Potteries;</p>
<p class='c018'>That there has not been a single death from typhus, or
any other form of continued fever, among the adults
in any of these buildings since their establishment;
and that during the two first visitations of epidemic
cholera, with the exception of two cases which occurred
under peculiar circumstances, there was no attack of
cholera in any of these buildings, while from four to
six deaths from the pestilence occurred in single
houses in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p class='c008'>Such are the results of the first imperfect attempt at
improvement; which, remarkable as they are, are not
more striking than the results of neglect. Of the children
born in the best part of a town one fifth die before they
attain the fifth year of age; of the children born in the
worst, one-half die before they attain their fifth year. The
inhabitants of the worst localities attain little more than one
half of the age of those who live in the best. Of 100,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>children born in Surrey, 75,423 attain the age of ten
years; 52,000 live to the age of fifty; and 28,878 live to
seventy. In Liverpool, out of 100,000 persons born, only
48,211 live ten years; 25,878 live fifty years; and 8373
live seventy years. The probable duration of life in Surrey
is 53 years; in Liverpool it is 26 years. Were the whole
of the metropolis as healthy as the Model Dwellings, there
would be an annual saving in London of nearly 20,000 lives.
But these lives are not saved; this number of persons is
allowed to perish every year, and they are as truly and as
needlessly sacrificed as if they were taken out on Bethnal-green
and shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we bear in mind the suffering which in every case
accompanies this waste of life, and the suffering which
must inevitably follow it, and remember that it is admitted
that these dreadful evils are remediable and preventible,
it is difficult to suppress the natural feelings of indignation
and of sorrow, that in a country calling itself Christian the
application of the known remedies should be so long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is right however to acknowledge that something has
been done, and is in progress, for the improvement of the
sanitary condition of the people. The principle is admitted
that it is the duty of the Legislature to deal with this
matter, and the first systematic legislative effort to bring
about a better state of things has been made.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Public Health Act is in operation, and the general
and proper application by local authorities of the powers
it confers would place every part of every town in Great
Britain in as good a sanitary condition, at least, as that of
the Model Dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up to the present time (1855) there are under this Act
196 towns, containing a population of upwards of 2¼ millions.
In about 50 of these towns, however, nothing has
yet been done.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Eleven towns, with a population of about half a million,
have adopted the powers of the Act in subsequent local
acts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Works of drainage and water supply are completed, or
are in an advanced state, in 70 towns.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is difficult at present to give the average cost of these
combined and complete sanitary works; but the total expense
for public and private works of drainage and water
supply for houses of from £10 to £20 per annual rental,
may be taken at 4d. per week per house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great obstacle to sanitary progress is the fear of
rates, not so much on the part of the poor, who gladly pay
for the improvements, but on the part of the owners of
small tenements, by whom chiefly opposition is raised to
the application of this Act.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the town of Alnwick, public and private works of
sewerage and drainage have been completed. There have
been laid down about twenty miles of sewers and drains,
and seventeen miles of apparatus for water supply, at a
total cost, for the combined works, of 4d. per week per
house for the term of thirty years; after the expiration of
which period the cost of the works, both principal and
interest, will have become liquidated, and the only expense
thereafter will be for maintenance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>On inspecting these works, I saw in the tenements occupied
by the lowest classes a high degree of cleanliness,
wholesomeness, and comfort, and heard from the inhabitants
an expression of the greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have as yet no certain knowledge of the extent to
which such works are capable of preventing sickness and
lengthening life. But the most perfect drainage, combined
with the most ample supply of water, will not alone secure
for the public health all which it is practicable to accomplish.
There must also be provision for the better construction
of the houses of the poor; for the prevention of
overcrowding; for street ventilation and cleansing, and
for the exclusion from the neighbourhood of human dwellings
of filth-creating animals and of noxious trades. When
all this is done, as it might be done, and as it would be
done were there a general perception of the crying evils it
would remedy, Epidemics would disappear, the more formidable
of them immediately, and all of them, I believe,
in the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the whole of these facts and observations we
see—</p>

<p class='c008'>1.  That Epidemics are under our own control; we may
promote their spread; we may prevent it. We may secure
ourselves from them. We have done so. We have banished
the most formidable. Those that remain are not so
difficult to be conquered as those that have been vanquished.
The causes of Typhus are more completely under our control
than those of Intermittent. We have banished Intermittent.
We may put an end to Typhus. We have
actually done so. We have encompassed the Model
Dwellings by a barrier which neither typhus, nor even
cholera, nor any of the other causes of excessive sickness
and premature mortality have been able to pass. To the
residents within that barrier the chance of life has been
almost doubled; to their children it has been doubled;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and compared with some other children of their own class
it has been increased fourfold.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  We see that Epidemics are not made by a Divine law
the necessary condition of man’s existence upon earth.
The boon of life is not marred with this penalty. The great
laws of nature, which are God’s ordinances in their regular
course and appointed operation, do form and give off
around us, products which are injurious to us; but He has
given us senses to perceive them, and reason to devise
the means of avoiding them, and epidemics arise and spread
because we will not regard the one, nor use the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  We see that there are circumstances which render it
doubtful whether civilization has yet attained a point that
places it beyond the danger of retrogression. States in
some respects of higher civilization than our own have
relapsed into barbarism. There is indeed one circumstance
which may give us hope; there is one humanizing principle
which is now at least recognized and in partial operation,
of which there is no trace in any nation of antiquity. I
mean the principle of kindness as a governing influence,
distinguished from the principle of brute force.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the whole human race is one family, that the people
of every colour, clime, language, government, and faith,
are one brotherhood, and that the same law of love which
is the bond of the union, strength, and happiness of a
single family, is equally binding on the universal family of
mankind, are the fundamental and distinguishing principles
of our religion; and in proportion to our conformity in
our private and public life to the spirit of these divine
principles, advancement in civilization is certain; relapse
into barbarism is impossible. But as yet there is no such
conformity. We neglect the education of the people,
quarrelling about the mode, and postponing the thing.
We devote to a life of absorbing labour the child and the
youth ungrounded in the elements of knowledge, untrained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to habits of self-restraint, thereby dooming the man to the
blankness and turbulence of ignorance and intemperance.
We equally neglect the sanitary condition of the people.
We make no provision for securing to the humblest classes,
and they can make none for themselves, the conditions
that are essential to their physical health, the loss of which
to them involves and includes every other. We thus
neglect body and mind, and then the disorders and vices
which necessarily follow we endeavour to repress by
punishments that harden but never reform, neither trusting
nor trying the influence of gentleness, which our religion
teaches us is stronger than ignorance, stronger than
crime, and can master both. It is this state of things that
places in danger the ark of civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, we see the first step that must be taken to elevate
the people: nay, even to bring them within the pale of the
civilization already attained. We must improve their
sanitary condition. Until this is done, no civilizing influence
can touch them. The schoolmaster will labour in
vain; the minister of religion will labour in vain; neither
can make any progress in the fulfilment of their mission
in a den of filth. Moral purity is incompatible with bodily
impurity. Moral degradation is indissolubly united with
physical squalor. The depression and discomfort of the
hovel produce and foster obtuseness of mind, hardness of
heart, selfish and sensual indulgence, violence, and crime.
It is the Home that makes the man; it is the home that
educates the family. It is the distinction and the curse of
Barbarism that it is without a home: it is the distinction
and the blessing of Civilization that it prepares a home in
which Christianity may abide, and guide, and govern.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>[From First and Second Reports on Quarantine. See Introduction. <span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The object of quarantine is to prevent the introduction
of epidemic diseases from one country into another, and
its regulations are based on the assumption of the contagiousness
of the diseases with which it deals; it being
supposed that such diseases are propagated by contact,
direct or indirect, of the unaffected with the affected. In
accordance with this view the preventive means adopted
by quarantine consist of the isolation of the sick or suspected,
with whom it interdicts all communication, whether
by person or by articles deemed capable of transmitting
contagion.</p>

<p class='c008'>When quarantine was first established, the spread of
epidemic diseases exclusively or chiefly by contagion was
a doctrine universally received;<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c005'><sup>[25]</sup></a> but during the last century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>a change has gradually taken place in professional
opinion in almost every country in Europe, particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>in France, Russia, and Austria, as well as in America,
with respect at least to several of these diseases, chiefly by
medical officers, who, having had the charge of the health
of fleets and armies in different quarters of the globe, have
been under the necessity of studying the circumstances
connected with the outbreak and spread of formidable
epidemics; and also by those who, having had the care of
hospitals and dispensaries in large cities, have been obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to visit the localities and abodes of the poorer classes,
where these diseases are always the most prevalent.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f25'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The wide difference between the qualifications of the accomplished popular
physician and the scientific investigator into the causes of epidemic sickness
was strikingly exhibited in the first outbreak of Asiatic cholera in 1831, when
the emergency required not merely a knowledge of the practice of medicine, but
the power also of applying the philosophy of public health to the exigencies of
the moment. How were these exigencies provided for?</p>

<p class='c007'>A board, comprising all the most eminent and skilful physicians of the day,
was assembled in the College of Physicians, under the presidency of Sir Henry
Halford; and, after declaring, in opposition to the unanimous opinion of the
physicians of Bengal, “that no measures of external precaution for preventing the
introduction of the cholera morbus by a rigorous quarantine have hitherto been
found effectual,” they issued the following official notification:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“To carry into effect the separation of the sick from the healthy, it would be
very expedient that one or more houses should be kept in view in each town or
its neighbourhood, as places to which every case of the disease, as soon as detected,
might be removed, provided the family of the afflicted person consent to
such removal; and, in case of refusal, a conspicuous mark, ‘SICK,’ should be
placed in front of the house, to warn persons that it is in quarantine; and even
when persons with the disease shall have been removed, and the house shall
have been purified, the word ‘CAUTION’ should be substituted, as denoting
suspicion of the disease; and the inhabitants of such house should not be at
liberty to move out or communicate with other persons until, by the authority
of the local board, the mark shall have been removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is recommended that those who may fall victims to this most formidable
disease should be buried in a detached ground, in the vicinity of the house that
may have been selected for the reception of cholera patients. By this regulation,
it is intended to confine, as much as possible, every source of infection to
one spot: on the same principle, all persons who may be employed in the removal
of the sick from their own houses, as well as all who may attend upon
cholera patients in the capacity of nurses, <i>should live apart</i> from the rest of the
community.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whenever objections arise to the removal of the sick from the healthy, or
other causes exist to render such a step not advisable, <i>the same</i> <span class='fss'>PROSPECT OF
SUCCESS IN EXTINGUISHING THE SEEDS OF THE PESTILENCE</span> cannot be expected.
Much, however, may be done, even in these difficult circumstances, by
following the <i>same principles of prudence</i>, and by avoiding all unnecessary communication
with the public out of doors: all articles of food or other necessaries
required by the family <i>should be placed in front of the house, and received by one
of the inhabitants of the house after the person delivering them shall have retired</i>.
Until the time during which the contagion of cholera lies dormant in the human
frame has been more minutely ascertained, it will be <i>necessary</i>, for the sake <i>of
perfect security</i>, that convalescents from the disease, and <i>those who have had
any communication with them</i>, should be kept under observation for a period of
<i>not less than twenty days</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All intercourse with any infected town and the neighbouring country must
be prevented, by the best means within the power of the magistrates, who will
have to make regulations for the supply of provisions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Other measures of a more coercive nature may be rendered expedient for
the common safety, if unfortunately so fatal a disease should ever show itself in
this country, in the terrific way in which it has appeared in various parts of
Europe; and it may become <i>necessary to draw troops or a strong body of police
around infected places, so as utterly to exclude the inhabitants from all intercourse
with the country</i>: and we feel sure that what is demanded for the common
safety of the state, will always be acquiesced in with a willing submission to the
necessity which imposes it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This announcement by the English physicians of 1831 was published throughout
the land in the form of an Order of the King in Council. But the strong
good sense of the public averted many of the mischiefs which these scientific
advisers would have produced, had their counsels been carried into execution.
The preventive measures which were eventually adopted by them consisted in
prohibiting intercourse between one town and another by sea, and permitting
it by land; thus, communication between London and Edinburgh by stage
coach was perfectly free and uninterrupted, while communication between those
capitals by sea was prohibited with such rigour that no interest, however
powerful, could procure an exemption. Francis Jeffrey—at this time holding
the high office of Lord Advocate of Scotland, and whose influence, from his
personal and official connections, was very great—was unable to obtain permission
for his faithful servant, in the last stage of dropsy, to go from London to Leith
by water, lest he should carry with him to his native country, by that mode of
conveyance, not the dropsy, which he had—but the cholera, which he had not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be sorry,” writes Jeffrey to Miss Cockburn, “to hear that poor
old Fergus is so ill that I fear he will die very soon. I have made great efforts
to get him shipped off to Scotland, where he most wishes to go; <i>but the quarantine
regulations are so absurdly severe, that, in spite of all my influence with
the Privy Council</i>, I have not been able to get a passage for him, <i>and he is
quite unable to travel by land</i>; he has decided water in the chest, and swelling
in all his limbs. The doctors say he may die any day, and that it is scarcely
possible he can recover.”—<i>Cockburn’s Life of Jeffrey</i>, p. 247.</p>

<p class='c007'>These examples are not adduced for the purpose of casting obloquy on Sir
Henry Halford, Dr Maton, and the other eminent physicians their colleagues,
who vainly attempted to reduce to practice in the nineteenth century, the
standard but obsolete doctrines taught, almost universally, in the medical schools
in the country; but solely for the purpose of displaying the state of the science
of Public Health in the year 1831–2, as far as the physicians of highest reputation
and largest practice may be taken as its exponents.—<i>Origin and Progress
of Sanitary Reform, by T. Jones Howell.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The consideration of the common properties of pestilence,
under whatever form or name it may occur, has led to the
general conclusion that the true safeguards against pestilential
diseases are not quarantine regulations, but sanitary
measures—that is to say, measures which tend to prevent
or remove certain conditions, without which pestilential
diseases appear to be incapable of existing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole machinery of quarantine is based on the
assumption that by an absolute interdiction of communication
with the sick, either by the person or by infected
articles, it can prevent the introduction of epidemic disease
into an unaffected community.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this assumption overlooks the essential condition
on which epidemic disease depends, namely,—the presence
of an epidemic atmosphere, without which it is now generally
admitted that no contagion, whether imported or
native, can cause a disease to spread epidemically. Allowing,
therefore, to contagion all the influence which any
one supposes it to possess, and to quarantine all the control
over it which it claims, there remains the condition,
the primary and essential condition, which confessedly it
cannot reach, namely, the epidemic atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>Experience affords evidence that the influence of an
epidemic atmosphere may exist over thousands of square
miles, and yet affect only particular localities. The cases
of cholera which have occurred in numerous and widely
distant parts of England and Scotland mark the presence
of the epidemic influence; yet over this extended area
cholera has fixed itself and prevailed as an epidemic only
in very few places. Why has it localized itself in these
particular places? Probably because it has there found
conditions of a specific kind, either local or personal, or
both. It follows that our true course is to make diligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>search for all localizing circumstances, and to remove them,
so as to render the locality untenantable for the epidemic.
But quarantine makes no such search, and leaves all localizing
conditions untouched and unthought of.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence the signal failure of quarantine as a means of
prevention, with reference at least to the most prevalent
epidemics, in all the nations of Europe in which it has
been tried in modern times; and hence the general relaxation,
and in some instances the total abandonment, of the
system of quarantine, with reference to several diseases
against which it was formerly rigidly enforced, and the
growing distrust in the supposition that measures of this
kind really afford protection against the introduction of any
epidemic disease into any country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The influence of great epidemics is not limited to human
beings; it extends to all classes of domestic animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is stated by Dr Thomas Lesslie Gregson, who was at
Alexandria during the prevalence of the great plague of
1836, on duty there as surgeon-in-chief to the Naval,
Military, and Civil Hospital, that cattle were attacked
with decided symptoms of plague some time before the
disease broke out among the human species. “Before
the disease broke out,” he says, “a number of the Pacha’s
oxen were seized with a malady, of which above one hundred
died in a few days. I was sent to investigate and
report on this epidemic. On examination I found gastroenterite
in the most intense degree; so much so, that I
have found extensive gangrene in oxen that have only
been observed ill twelve hours. They had also large
buboes. This I reported plague, and caused them to be
interred deeply.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Quarantine is based on the assumption that epidemic
diseases depend upon a specific contagion; but the question
of contagion has no necessary connection with that of
quarantine. The real question is whether quarantine can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>prevent the extension of epidemic diseases, whatever may
be their nature, whether contagious or not. If it can, it
is valuable beyond price; if it cannot, it is a barbarous
encumbrance, interrupting commerce, obstructing international
intercourse, periling life, and wasting, and worse
than wasting, large sums of the public money.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the power of protecting the country from the introduction
and spread of disease, whether contagious or
otherwise, claimed by quarantine, be really possessed by
it, this must be proved by other considerations than those
which establish the contagiousness of disease; it is a mere
matter of evidence and experience, and consequently the
disputed point of contagion should be placed entirely out
of view in this discussion, and the whole question should
be argued on the broad ground whether or not quarantine
is a public security, or is capable of affording practically
any useful result.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is indeed one point of view in which it may be
proper, and even necessary, to consider the question of
contagion with relation to that of quarantine. Assuming
the existence of contagion, if it can be proved that quarantine,
instead of affording any protection against contagion,
absolutely fosters it, then the stronger the proof of contagion
the more decisive the argument presented by it
against quarantine; and it will be shown hereafter that this
is the true and the only relation in which contagion stands
to this question.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no more reason why the controversy on contagion
should complicate the question of quarantine than
why it should continue to encumber the general subject of
the removable causes of disease, from which efforts have
long been made to disentangle it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The discussion whether epidemic diseases arise and
spread from contagion or from common or specific poisons
generated in the localities in which these pestilences first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>break out, has nothing whatever to do with quarantine, the
sole inquiry with reference to this question being whether,
however epidemic diseases arise, quarantine can prevent
their introduction into a country or arrest their progress
when there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few will question that the progress of the opinion of
observers in Europe during the last half-century has been
steadily towards a material modification, if not an entire
abandonment, of the doctrine of contagion with reference
to the majority of epidemic diseases, taking the word contagion
in its strict sense, that is, the communicability of
disease exclusively by contact: direct, that is, with the
body or breath of an infected person; or indirect, with
something which an infected person has touched.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cholera may be taken as an example of the diseases of
the epidemic class. When cholera first invaded Europe
in 1831,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c005'><sup>[26]</sup></a> the belief in its contagious nature was almost
universal, and in this country in particular there was
scarcely a medical man who did not entertain this conviction;
but as in India, where this disease is known, the
belief in its contagious nature is universally abandoned, so
in Europe it gradually diminished in proportion as opportunities
of observing the disease increased; and now in
Russia, Poland, Prussia, France, Belgium, and England,
the contrary view, with few exceptions, is maintained.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f26'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See note p. 61.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There has been much confusion of terms in respect to
the use of the words contagion and non-contagion. Professional
men have avowed their belief of the contagiousness
of typhus, and stated that they had experienced it in
their own persons. When asked for the evidence on
which the belief was founded, they have usually related
some circumstances showing, not the contagiousness, but
the infectiousness of the disease. Contagion is a term
applicable to a different set of circumstances. According
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>to the hypothesis of contagion, no matter how pure the
air, no matter what the condition of the fever ward, if the
physician only feels the pulse of the patient, or touches
him with the sleeve of his coat, though he may not catch
the disease himself, he may communicate it by a shake of
the hand to the next friend he meets; or that friend,
without catching it himself, may give it to another; or if
the physician wash and fumigate his hand, but neglect
the cuff of his coat, he may still convey the deadly poison
to every patient whose pulse he feels during the day. If
this were so, the track of a general practitioner who
attended one patient labouring under a specific epidemic
disease would be marked by the seizure of the rest of his
patients; if it were true of cholera and typhus, the members
of the General Board of Health must have fallen by
these diseases, who from morning until night received inspectors
that came from places where these epidemics were
rife; and if any disease of common occurrence really possessed
such powers of communication and diffusion, it is
difficult to conceive how it is that the human race has not
been long since extinguished.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c005'><sup>[27]</sup></a> To assume the method of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>propagation by touch, whether by the person or of infected
articles, and to overlook that by the corruption of the air,
is at once to increase the real danger, from exposure to
noxious effluvia, and to divert attention from the true
means of remedy and prevention. It is not in human
power to take from any disease the property of contagion,
if this property really belongs to it; but it is in our power
to guard against and prevent the effects of any contagion,
however intense; and it is equally in our power to avoid
communicating to common disease an infectious character,
and aggravating it into pestilence.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f27'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In January, 1866, the members of the Aberdeenshire Cattle Plague Association
being much interested in the question as to how the disease could possibly
have reached Pitmillan, Fovernan, no suspicious communication by beast or
otherwise having taken place with the farm for weeks, Mr Hay, veterinary
surgeon, inspector for the county, gave the following explanation of the matter
in a letter to Mr Barclay, the hon. secretary:—“I am happy to be able to
satisfy the public mind as to how the disease was brought to Pitmillan. About
Christmas Mr Fraser got from Mr Duncan, flesher, Aberdeen, a quantity of beef
rolled up in packsheet, which had apparently paid several visits to London
round carcases, and doubtless mingled there with many of its kind from various
places of the kingdom. After being removed from the beef at Pitmillan, this
packsheet was thrown aside for some time, when one of the servant girls took
and used it (unwashed) as an apron for a considerable period before the first
cow got bad, and was carrying the kail in it to the cow after she was taken ill.
You see by this that we are liable to get the disease at any time. Tons of
packsheet return weekly by railway, and no surer agent could be employed to
bring rinderpest to the country.”
The secretary having some doubt about the guilt of the packsheet (which
however, was gravely accused in both Houses of Parliament), reported his
opinion that the contagion was conveyed by the wind! [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If indeed the emanations thrown off from the living
body formed permanent and powerful poisons, like miasms
connected with the products of decomposition, and if they
were, like such products, capable of being conveyed unchanged
to great distances, we should be able to live only
in solitude; we could never meet in society, for we should
poison each other; the first symptom of illness would be
the signal for the abandonment of the sick, and we should
be compelled by a due regard to self-preservation to withhold
from persons afflicted with disease every kind and
degree of assistance that required personal attendance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Happily, we are not so constituted, and the evidence
that has been adduced of the narrowness of the sphere
even of the most virulent contagion, shows the groundlessness
of the alarm sometimes entertained respecting
this dreaded agent, while it points to the certain means
of destroying it. The London Fever Hospital is separated
from the Small-Pox Hospital only by the space of between
thirty and forty feet, and the windows of the
wards of both establishments are immediately opposite
each other: yet there is no instance of the communication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of small-pox to the typhus patients, nor of typhus to
the small-pox patients; nor of either disease to the convalescent,
or to the official inmates of the adjoining
establishment. There does not appear to be a single instance
on record, in any country, of the extension of
infection beyond the walls of an hospital, or even of a
lazar-house, so as to injure in any manner the nearest
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>But though it appears that modern experience and
research have shed considerable light on the origin and
progress of epidemic diseases, yet there are still some circumstances
connected with their propagation which the
present state of our knowledge does not enable us to understand,
and which therefore appear to us as difficulties.</p>

<p class='c008'>These cases are sometimes termed exceptional; but
they are only apparent, not real, exceptions; as in all other
departments of human research, they are merely indications
of the imperfection of our knowledge, and advancing
science will unquestionably one day so elucidate these
very exceptions, as to render them additional confirmations
of the true conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the present state of popular opinion it has been
deemed requisite to enter into this detailed consideration
of the general subject of contagion, because it appears
that in proportion as undue weight is attached to this
dreaded agent the effect is mischievous; since, “it diverts
attention from the true source of danger, and the real
means of protection, and fixes it on those which are imaginary;
creates panic; leads to the neglect and abandonment
of the sick; occasions great expense for what is
worse than useless; and withdraws attention from that
brief but important interval between the commencement
and the development of disease, during which remedial
measures are most effective in its cure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is also necessary to examine the questions of contagion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and quarantine apart from each other, because there are
points of obscurity, and therefore grounds for controversy,
which, in the present state of our knowledge, may be
reasonably considered as belonging to the former, that do
not attach to the latter. The inquiry with reference to
quarantine, indeed, is simple, and lies in a narrow compass.
The sole question to be determined is, whether or
not it accomplishes, or is capable of accomplishing, its professed
object, and this is a mere question of evidence and
experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>The object of quarantine is to prevent the introduction
of epidemic diseases from one country into another, and
the agency which it employs for this purpose is the isolation
of the sick; the detention of, and the placing under
inspection for a given period, persons who come from an
infected country or district, though they may not be
actually sick; and the purification of articles of commerce
presumed to be capable of imbibing and conveying
pestilential virus, before such articles are landed and dispersed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears that facts and observations place beyond all
reasonable doubt the utter inutility of this system.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there be any truth in the preceding representation,
that epidemic diseases are universally and inseparably connected
with an epidemic atmosphere, the question is at
once decided. Quarantine can exercise no more control
over this epidemic atmosphere than over the electricity
and temperature of the common atmosphere, and the direction
and force of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be true that epidemic diseases, such, for example,
as influenza and cholera, traverse the globe in determinate
courses or zones, and often spread from country to country,
and through the vast populations of their great cities,
in single weeks, and even days, it must be futile to array
such a machinery as that of quarantine, that is to say, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>vessel placed at the entrance of one or two seaport towns,
a line of soldiers guarding a few miles of the frontier, of a
particular country against morbific agents, which pursue
their course like the blight that destroys the vegetation of
a country in a night, and which extend their influence
over the greater part of the habitable globe.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be true that the epidemic influence precedes the
actual outbreak of epidemic disease—that that epidemic
influence is present in a country, creating a predisposition
or susceptibility to disease before the epidemic appears in
its true and recognized form,—quarantine must be futile,
because, before it takes its precautions or erects its barriers,
such as they are, the epidemic is already in the country
busy in action, vitiating the blood of the most susceptible
of the population, and preparing the way for its
general attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be true, as ancient and modern authorities are
agreed, that, without the essential preliminary of an epidemic
atmosphere on the spot, foreign contagion is inert,
and that, unless both concur, no pestilence ensues, quarantine
under any circumstances must be useless; for in the
absence of an epidemic atmosphere it must be useless, because
then no disease will spread beyond the individual
affected; and with the presence of an epidemic atmosphere
it must be useless, because then the disease will spread
wherever the infected atmosphere goes and finds favouring
conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the preceding principle be true, it must be futile to
place vessels coming from infected countries in quarantine,
unless those vessels are capable of bringing with them an
epidemic atmosphere, and unless quarantine can control
such an atmosphere when imported; and the uselessness of
this procedure will be placed in a still stronger light when
recent experience as to the comparative insusceptibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Europeans, though resident on the spot, to plague itself is
considered.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c005'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f28'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr W. H. Burrell, Deputy Inspector-general of Hospitals, who was three years
Principal Medical Officer at Malta, presented, in 1852, to the General Board of
Health, an elaborate examination on the plague which had formerly raged in
that island. The following are the conclusions to which he had arrived:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. There is no evidence to prove, or even to render it probable, that the
plague was introduced either into Malta in 1813 or into Gozo in 1814 by importation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. There is every reason to believe that the plague existed in Malta at the
time of the arrival of the ship supposed to have introduced the disease; and
that in Gozo the first case (a stranger) contracted the disease from local causes,
which enhanced by quarantine, produced it in others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“3. The lower orders, and those occupying the lowest, most crowded, and
worst ventilated dwellings, furnished the great majority of cases; which
decreased in proportion with improvement in these respects.</p>

<p class='c007'>“4. As this discriminative preference of the disease to attack certain classes,
living in certain localities, never obtains to the same extent with diseases arising
from a specific contagion, it is more than probable that the causes engaged in
the generation of the plague are not constant, but variable and accidental; its
initial cause, the peculiar atmospheric constitution, having no power to develop
the disease, unassisted by season and local conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“5. The transmissibility of plague from person to person out of the noxious
atmosphere in which it originated—the only certain test of such a power—has
not been proved by the four instances, during thirty-eight years, in
which it is alleged to have been communicated to persons employed by the
Quarantine Department of Malta, carbuncular affections being endemic among
the population of this island.</p>

<p class='c007'>“6. Quarantine restrictions enforced by the penalties of <i>corporal punishment</i>
and <i>death</i>, and seconded by the greatest dread of contact with suspected
persons or things, among the panic-struck populations of Malta and Gozo,
utterly failed to arrest the progress of plague; on the contrary, where these
restrictions were carried to their utmost limits by an absolute power, there the
disease persisted longest, and the mortality was greatest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All these circumstances,” says the French Dr Chervin, speaking of the restrictions
and cruelties of quarantine, “are calculated to fill with horror the
breast of every feeling and honest man; and we are really obliged to offer
violence to ourselves in not giving vent to our indignation against the partisans
of contagion, who yet desire to continue to defend their erroneous opinions, and
who, to this day, have used all their efforts to make obscure and disfigure the subject,
to the great detriment of truth;—who have never ceased to deceive governments,
which think it their duty, with regard to this disease [Yellow Fever], to
surrender themselves to the judgment and knowledge of medical men,—who have
never ceased to describe it as contagious, and have induced those authorities to
adopt, with respect to it, the most false and contrary measures, and to neglect
the suitable, prophylactic, and <i>preservative</i> means, and others which might have
put an end to the disastrous epidemics of this disease;—thus it is they have always
acted contrary to truth, to the interest of governments and of humanity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am of opinion,” says Dr Reece, of New York, “that the oppressive features
of our quarantine system should be reckoned among the relics of barbarism
which an enlightened Legislature should make haste to abrogate for the sake
of our character as a people. There is no pretext for the perpetuation of a
system founded in ignorance, and fruitful only in public and private injustice,
cruelty, and wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cholera,” says Professor Caldwell, of America, “though a fatal scourge to
the world, will, through the wise beneficent dispensation under which we live,
be productive of consequences favourable alike to science and humanity. Besides
being instrumental in throwing much light on the practice of physic, it
will prove highly influential in extinguishing the belief in pestilential contagion,
and bringing into disrepute the quarantine establishments that have hitherto
existed.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>If the great practical truth, taught by modern investigation
and experience, be, that the only real security against
any kind and degree of epidemic disease is an abundant
and constant supply of pure air, the prevention of overcrowding,
and the dispersion of the sick; and if, as is
generally agreed, confinement in a foul atmosphere can
convert common fever into pestilence, and ventilation and
dispersion can dissipate any contagion, then quarantine
must be not only useless but pernicious, since the invariable
effect of quarantine as hitherto practised in all
countries has been the congregation and confinement of
the sick, and of those who, though not actually sick, are
suspected to have in them the seeds of disease, requiring
only a few days or hours for their development,—the congregation
and confinement of such persons in a limited
space, often in a filthy ship and an unhealthy locality, and
always under circumstances calculated to excite apprehension
and alarm—conditions in the highest degree
favourable to the generation and spread of disease: it follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that quarantine, instead of guarding against and
preventing disease, fosters and concentrates it, and places
it under conditions the most favourable that can be devised
for its general extension; and therefore must not
only fail to accomplish its object, but tend to produce the
very calamity which it endeavours to prevent.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The principal ground on which objection is made to the
continuance of quarantine is that the fundamental principle
on which it is based is fallacious, and that the only
means of preventing the origin and spread of epidemic
disease is the adoption of sanitary measures. Substitution
of sanitary measures for quarantine restrictions would
render the importation of any disease from one country
into another in the highest degree improbable.</p>

<p class='c008'>There has been and continues to be a popular impression
of the importation or the contagiousness of disease,
created by the frequent occurrence of epidemic diseases
amongst itinerant classes of the population. Seeing the
occurrence of such diseases amongst those who travel,
it is an easy and apparently a natural inference that
the diseases are carried by them. Thus, the low
tramps’ lodging-houses in our towns were in the Sanitary
Report shown to be throughout the country the
worst of fever-nests in each place; but they were also
shown at the same time to be the places where there was
the most overcrowding and the greatest filth. With a
stationary population, with the same overcrowding and
filth, it may be confidently pronounced that the disease
would be worse. When by bad weather the tramps are
detained and kept stationary, it is worse. The tramping
about from town to town and in the open air—the movement
which to superficial observation imports the disease—in
reality mitigates it. From what we have already
said, it is consistent with this general statement that tramps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>infected with fever in one place may carry it with them
and spread infection in another place amongst classes of
persons predisposed by the like habits and conditions, as
was exemplified in the spreading of the Pali plague. Of
late times the poor Irish emigrants are said to have imported
fever into this country; they are represented, for
example, to have imported fever into Liverpool; but the
description of the places where the fever burst out, and
the overcrowding in them, displayed fever-nests sufficient
to have produced fatal results on the most robust of the
stationary populations. “In one small cellar with no
window,” a gentleman, who ministered to the wants of the
poor people who had crept for shelter into damp uninhabited
houses, and who, it was stated, fell a victim to the
contagious nature of the fever, found “eighteen persons
in fever, lying on wet dirty straw. In one house he
counted eighty-one, in another sixty-one, in every stage of
fever, on straw in the corners.” It would be surprising
if the poor Irish had not imported fever into the lower
districts of towns, when, as in Glasgow, they have added
10,000 annually to the already overcrowded and wretched
population of that city; just as the miserable refugees
from the infected villages of Ragpootana carried the pestilence
into the close, filthy, and already overcrowded huts
of the neighbouring villages. But the conditions in which
the Irish emigrants have arrived, and have been crowded
together in the towns as well as on shipboard, are just the
conditions in which fevers arise amidst stationary populations;
and, we may confidently state, would have been
worse had the particular class of migrants been stationary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The like delusion as to the <i>importation</i> of disease is
created by the appearance of fever amongst the migrants
at sea. It is important that the universal effects of overcrowding,
filth, and atmospheric impurity should be known
and discriminated in all cases. It will be seen that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>produce their effects at sea as well as elsewhere. It
appears to be most important also to display the facts as
to the common existence of the conditions of fever in
ships themselves as at present regulated; and that, if properly
regulated, instead of being fever-nests or “the
means of importation” of the disease, a voyage in the
open sea would become a sure means of arresting any such
disease. Epidemic disease is often more severe in ships
when stationary in port than when sailing, and with them
the passage in fair weather when overcrowding is avoided
is a means of mitigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sanitary regulation of the ships themselves—a
measure of the utmost importance to the seafaring classes
of the community—would accomplish far more than could
be hoped for or pretended to be accomplished by any
known system of quarantine, and would have, moreover,
a beneficial effect upon popular opinion by removing the
fallacious appearances which favour the belief in imported
disease, while they divert attention from the true causes
of disease, the removable and preventible causes that exist
on the spot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The basis of sanitary legislation is the evidence that has
been accumulated in relation to the whole of the epidemic,
endemic, and contagious diseases, and the latest opinions
of medical authorities with reference to them. It having
been shown by indubitable evidence that the prevalence
and mortality of typhus, scarlatina, cholera, and every
other epidemic disease, are uniformly in proportion to the
low sanitary condition of the population, the Legislature
has decided on attempting to check the prevalence of
these diseases by laying the foundation of sanitary improvement.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c005'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
It appears that the measures adopted by the
Legislature with this view should be consistently carried
out and applied to the dwellings of all classes of the population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>whether on land or at sea. In the larger vessels in
which well-directed care has been exercised, the general
ill-health has been reduced below the average ill-health of
populations of the like ages on shore; but from the evidence
which has been brought from witnesses at the ports,
medical men well acquainted from long practice in the
mercantile marine, it appears that the <i>general</i> condition of
merchant-vessels, and of the forecastle in which common
seamen are, for the most part, lodged, renders them in
effect cellar-dwellings, just as dark, foul, and unventilated,
as the filthy, unaired, and dismal cellars on shore with
which the Legislature has endeavoured to deal. It appears
also that typhus and other epidemic diseases do break out
at sea in these movable cellars, just as they do in the
cellars of the dirtiest courts on shore; and were it not that
seamen work in a purer external atmosphere, that they
are below decks comparatively for short intervals only,
and that in general they are men at the most robust
periods of life, it is probable that epidemic disease would
be still more frequent among them; an inference supported
by the fact that whenever passengers, emigrants,
and others are, owing to stormy weather, much confined
to the berths below, some form of malignant disease is
almost sure to break out.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>There are not wanting instances in which the energetic
adoption of such measures as were available, particularly
the enforcement of all practicable means of cleansing, and
the resolute removal of nuisances, warded off Cholera to a
very great extent, even under circumstances in which a
formidable attack appeared inevitable; and perhaps it may
serve for encouragement and guidance to direct attention
to one or two of such examples.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c005'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f30'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The two following examples are taken from “Results of Sanitary Improvement,”
by Dr Southwood Smith, 1854. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>One of the most remarkable of these occurred at Baltimore,
during the prevalence of epidemic cholera in
America, in 1849.</p>

<p class='c008'>The population of that city was about 149,000 souls.
The site of the town is naturally salubrious, and parts of
it are well built; but the districts near the river occupied
by the poorer classes are low and damp, and liable to
remittent and intermittent fevers, and, therefore, predisposed
to cholera.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the spring of 1849, the pestilence, which had attacked
with great violence several neighbouring towns, appeared
to be close upon the city. A general conviction prevailed,
both among the authorities and the citizens, that uncleanliness
had much to do with the development and spread of
the disease; they therefore spared neither money nor
labour to purify the city, and they gave the execution of
the cleansing operations to experienced and energetic
officers, who performed the work so vigorously, that it was
generally admitted that never before had the town been in
so clean a state, or so thoroughly purified, as during the
summer months of the year 1849.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the middle of June, while cholera was prevailing
at New York, Cincinnati, and other places, north and west
of Baltimore, diarrhœa broke out, and became general over
the whole city, accompanied by another symptom which
was universal, affecting even those who had no positive
attack of diarrhœa; namely, an indefinable sense of oppression
over the whole region of the abdomen, seldom amounting
to pain, but constantly calling attention to that part
of the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At that time,” says the medical officer of the city, “I
felt assured that the poison which produced cholera pervaded
the city; that it was brooding over us; that we
were already under its influence, and I anticipated
momentarily an outbreak of the epidemic. In about two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>weeks, however, from the commencement of this diarrhœa,
and the prevalence of the uneasy sensation which accompanied
it, these symptoms began to subside, and in a short
time they wholly disappeared. Simultaneously with their
disappearance, cholera broke out at Richmond, and other
towns south of Baltimore. I then felt assured that the fuel
necessary to co-operate with this poison did not exist in
our city: that the cloud had passed over us and left us
unharmed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No case of cholera was reported to the Board of Health
or other authorities of the town as having occurred during
this time; but on close examination, it was ascertained
that four deaths had taken place from the disease in its
most virulent form.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the cholera poison had really pervaded the city,
was appallingly evinced by an event which occurred in its
immediate vicinity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Baltimore almshouse is situated about two miles
from the city, on sloping ground, remarkable for its beauty
and salubrity, in immediate contiguity with the country-seats
of several of the wealthy families of the town. It is
surrounded by a farm of upwards of 200 acres, belonging
to the establishment, for the most part under cultivation.
The building is capable of accommodating between 600
and 700 inmates. An enclosure of about five acres, surrounded
by a wall, adjoins the main building upon its
north side. In the rear of this north wall is a ravine,
which at one point approaches the wall to within about
nine feet. This ravine is the outlet for all the filth of the
establishment. It is dry in summer, but retentive of wet
after rain. The space between the wall and the bed of the
ravine is not under tillage, but is overgrown with a rank,
weedy vegetation, common in rich waste soils. The physician
of the establishment, under the same apprehension
of an outbreak of cholera as had prevailed in Baltimore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>had taken the same precautions against the disease, and
had placed the establishment itself in a state of scrupulous
cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first of July cholera attacked one of the inmates.
On the seventh a second attack occurred. This was
followed in rapid succession by other seizures, and within
the space of one month 99 inmates of the establishment
had perished by cholera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the building and grounds the most diligent
search failed to discover anything that could account for
this outbreak; but on examining the premises outside the
northern wall, there was found a vast mass of filth, consisting
of the overflowings of cesspools, the drainage from pigsties,
and the general refuse of the establishment. “In
short,” says the medical officer, “the whole space included
between the ravine and the wall, upon its north side, was
one putrid and pestilential mass, capable of generating,
under the ardent rays of a Midsummer sun, the most
poisonous and deadly exhalations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>During the greater part of the time that this outbreak
continued, a slight breeze set in pretty steadily from the
north, conveying the poisonous exhalations from behind
the north wall directly over the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first persons attacked were those who happened to
be particularly exposed to the air blowing from the north
side of the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the male side of the house there was no protection
from the ravine. The female side was partially protected
by three rows of trees. The residents on the women’s
side were more numerous than on the men’s, but the
attacks were considerably less.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the paupers, those who slept in apartments
exposed to the north were attacked, those not so exposed
generally escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the basement story of a building, opening directly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the north, and close to a spot which received the contents
of one of the cesspools, 17 lunatics were lodged, all of
whom were attacked, and all died.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eight medical students were attached to the establishment,
of whom four occupied apartments with a northern
exposure, and four were lodged in rooms with a southern
exposure. The four whose rooms were exposed to the
north were attacked, the four whose rooms were not thus
exposed escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manager, also, who slept in a room above that of
the students looking to the north, was attacked: his family,
whose rooms looked to the south, escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men, after some difficulty and delay, were employed to
remove the filth and drain the ravine, the whole surface of
which, after having been thoroughly cleansed by a stream
of water, was thickly covered with lime, over which was
put a deep stratum of earth. The men employed in this
work were attacked with cholera, as were some of the
several inmates of the almshouse who had been dispersed
throughout Baltimore, but the disease did not spread to
any other persons in the city. From the 25th of July, the
day on which the drainage was completed, the disease
suddenly declined from 11 the day previous, to 3, and, by
the 9th of August, had entirely disappeared.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>In the case of Baltimore, and the Baltimore almshouse,
a neglected spot was severely visited by the pestilence,
while, by well-directed exertion, an entire city escaped.
In our own country an instance has lately occurred (1854)
in which, by similar exertion, a particular spot escaped,
while a populous town was devastated by the plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>No town in Great Britain has ever been so severely
visited by cholera as Newcastle, yet the garrison of Newcastle
has wholly escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>The barracks in which the garrison of Newcastle is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>quartered are situated about three-quarters of a mile from
the centre of the town. In houses at distances varying
from 20 to 200 yards of the barrack gates, numerous
deaths from cholera took place, and in a village 250 yards
from the barracks the pestilence prevailed to a frightful
extent for many days, numbering one or more victims in
almost every cottage.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the outbreak of the pestilence in the town, the
medical officers of the garrison, with the sanction and
assistance of their superior officers, exerted themselves
with great promptitude and energy to carry into effect all
the means at their command, calculated to lessen the
severity of an attack from which they could not hope
altogether to escape. The sewers, drains, privies, and
ashpits were thoroughly cleansed; all accumulations of
filth were removed; the spots where such filth had been
collected were purified; the freest possible ventilation
was established day and night in living and sleeping
rooms; overcrowding was guarded against; the diet of
the residents was, as far as practicable, regulated; the
men were strictly confined to barracks after evening roll-call,
and were forbidden to go into the low and infected
parts of the town; amusements were encouraged in the
vicinity of the barracks; every endeavour was made to
procure a cheerful compliance with the requirements
insisted on, without exciting fear; and there was a
medical inspection of the men twice, and of the women
and children, once daily.</p>

<p class='c008'>The influence of the epidemic poison upon the troops
was demonstrated by the fact that among 519 persons, the
total strength of the garrison, there were 451 cases of
premonitory diarrhœa, of which 421 were among the 391
men, irrespective of the officers, women, and children, the
attacks being in some instances obstinate, and recurring
more than once. Yet such was the success of the judicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>measures which had been adopted, that no case of
cholera occurred within the barracks during the whole
period of the epidemic; and every case of diarrhœa was
stopped from passing on to the developed stage of the disease:
while in Newcastle there were upwards of 4000
attacks, and 1543 deaths.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c005'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Results of Sanitary Improvement by Dr Southwood Smith, 1854.</p>
</div>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The case of the “Eclair,” and the history of the Epidemic
Fever which occurred at Boa Vista in 1845, have
been declared by high medical authority to afford “conclusive
evidence that Yellow Fever is sometimes imported.”
It will therefore be necessary to make a careful examination
of the circumstances relative to this Epidemic.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been affirmed, and generally credited, that unusual
effort has been made to ascertain the facts of this
case under circumstances more than commonly favourable
to the discovery of the truth. Two official Reports respecting
it, drawn up after personal inspection on the spot,
have indeed been presented to Parliament—one by Dr McWilliam,
and the other by Dr King; and several official
notices of these reports have been published; but the evidence
on which these two Reports were founded was not
collected until some time after the cessation of the epidemic.
The statements of witnesses, for the most part
poor and ignorant, many of whom had a direct interest in
establishing the importation of the disease by a British
ship, have been admitted implicitly, even with respect to
dates and circumstances not of recent occurrence, and
without due examination of the credibility of their testimony;
and on all material points the reporters have
arrived at directly opposite conclusions.</p>

<p class='c008'>On a review and comparison of the whole of the statements
which have been made with respect to this case, it
appears that the steam-ship “Eclair,” with a crew of 140
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>officers and men, proceeded in 1844 to the coast of Africa,
and was stationed for upwards of four months (130 days)
at the island of Sherboro, with a view to blockade the
eastern outlet of the passage at Shebar. This place is
considered one of the most unhealthy on the African coast;
vessels remaining near the island very rarely escaping an
outbreak of Yellow Fever on board. The land is represented
as low lying, some parts being marshy, and the
rest thickly wooded, and abounding in rank vegetation.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the account of the surgeon of the “Eclair,”
Mr Maconchy, the ship on this occasion was anchored at
the mouth of the river, in position where she “was surrounded
with filthy-looking river water, urged backwards
and forwards by the tides through extensive tracts of
mangrove bushes.” The fresh water used on board was
also bad, holding in solution a quantity of offensive vegetable
matter, which produced in some of the crew attacks
like mild cholera. The men, in parties of from 30 to 40,
were often sent up the river on boating expeditions, where
they remained for seven or eight days at a time exposed,
“whether they slept on board or ashore, perhaps after a
hard day’s labour, to all the exciting causes of fever, and
a tainted nocturnal atmosphere, in the rainy season, heavy
weather having set in, and the men constantly getting as
wet as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger of this boating service is thus stated by
Dr King:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The duty in boats up African rivers involves considerable
risk at any time of the year, but it can never be practised
in the rainy season without endangering the health
and lives of all who are employed, and such were evidently
the sad consequences of the boat expeditions of the
‘Eclair.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The crew, according to Mr Maconchy, in addition to
this dangerous service, and the dreariness and monotony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of the situation, were exposed to another depressing agency,
“from seeing the prizes of other ships passing frequently
to Sierra Leone, whilst they considered themselves
out of the reach of such good fortune.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another cause was probably in operation even at this
time, namely, the foul condition of the ship, as will hereafter
appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under these circumstances, fever broke out on board
the ship, and proved fatal to ten of the crew; eight of the
ten deaths being considered by the medical officers as directly
consequent on the boating expeditions. Though
there were other and severe cases of sickness on board,
these deaths appear to include the whole of the ship’s
mortality during her stay at Sherboro, a period, as has
been stated, of above four months.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the month of July the “Eclair” left this station, returned
to Sierra Leone, and anchored in the harbour,
where she appears to have remained 13 days. This happened
to be the rainy season. The crew went on shore,
where several of them remained at night unable to reach
the ship from being in a state of helpless intoxication.</p>

<p class='c008'>The consequences were soon apparent. While the ship
remained in the harbour, fever again broke out on board
with great violence, and continued without intermission
during this and the following month. In this sickly state
she again left Sierra Leone, proceeded northward in company
with another ship, the “Albert,” and anchored in the
Gambia on the 10th of August “(one of the most unhealthy
months at that place),” where she remained until the 15th.
All this time, the fever steadily increasing, she arrived on
the 21st of August at Boa Vista. She had now lost, since
leaving Sherboro, 13 more of her crew, making in all,
from the first outbreak of the disease at Sherboro, 37
attacks and 23 deaths; that is, 1 in 6 of the crew had
died.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>On anchoring in the harbour of Boa Vista, pratique was
at once offered to her commander, Captain Estcourt, but
he replied that he could not think of accepting it until he
had communicated the state of his vessel to the authorities
on shore. After some deliberation the Governor-General
consented to the landing of the ship’s company,
in the hope that the formidable disease, by which so many
had already perished, and so many others were still placed
in imminent danger, might be checked. Accordingly the
crew, both the healthy and the sick, were sent to a Fort on
an islet a mile distant from the town (Porto Sal Rey), and
the officers were lodged in the town itself. This took
place on the 31st of August.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hope of benefiting the crew by the change of their
quarters from the ship to the land was not realized. On
the contrary, the sickness continued to increase with so
much virulence that, at the end of the third week after the
arrival of the ship at Boa Vista, no fewer than 60 fresh
cases were added to the sick list, and some deaths took
place nearly every day.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this state of things a consultation of the medical officers
was held on the condition of the crew, the result of
which was a recommendation that the ship should immediately
proceed to Madeira, and if the fever received no
check, that she should go on to England. In conformity
with this advice, the whole of the crew, the sick as well as
the healthy, were forthwith re-embarked, and the ship
sailed from Boa Vista on the following day, namely, the
13th of September.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sequel to this sad narrative shows that no improvement
took place during the passage of the “Eclair” to
Madeira, where she was refused pratique. She therefore
proceeded next day on her voyage to England, and anchored
off the Isle of Wight, at the Motherbank, on the
28th of September, having lost, since sailing from Boa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Vista, 12 more of her crew. Thus in the short space of
37 days, that is, from the time when she anchored at Boa
Vista on the 21st of August, till her arrival at the Motherbank
on the 28th of September, there occurred no less
than 90 attacks and 45 deaths, including the death of her
excellent and devoted captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>On her arrival in England the ship was put in quarantine,
and remained under the direction of the Privy Council
until the 31st of October.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the day following her arrival, Dr Richardson proposed
that the sick should be immediately removed to a
wing of Haslar Hospital, to be appropriated exclusively
for them; stating, that in his opinion, if the sick were
placed in well-ventilated wards, with fresh bedding, and
the other means of cleanliness afforded by an hospital,
there would be no further risk to the attendants than
would occur in wards set apart for cases of typhus
fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>To this advice, Sir William Pym objected, and instead
of allowing the removal of the sick, he ordered the vessel,
with the whole of her crew, to proceed from the Motherbank
to the Foul Bill Quarantine Station at Standgate
Creek, which place she did not reach until the afternoon
of the 2nd of October, that is, four days after her arrival
at the Motherbank, where they remained six days more
before their removal into another vessel. Thus were all on
board detained close prisoners in a pestilential atmosphere
on the shores of their native land; their anticipations that
at length they should quit the scene of such terrible sufferings,
and of so many horrors, their hopes of life and health,
totally destroyed. The consequence was, that within these
ten days, five more deaths took place, nor was it until the
Lords of the Admiralty declared their conviction that the
only means of preserving the lives of the survivors of the
crew would be the entire removal of every individual from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>this ill-fated ship, that they were permitted to quit it.
Their removal took place on the 8th of October, after
which event two more deaths occurred, one of them being
that of the pilot who took the vessel from the Motherbank
to Standgate Creek.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c005'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f32'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A striking contrast to this treatment of the crew of the “Eclair” is exhibited
in the case of Her Majesty’s frigate, the “Arethusa,” which recently
(Feb. 14, 1852) arrived at Plymouth from Lisbon, having on board cases of
small-pox. Instead of putting the ship in quarantine, and confining the healthy
in the same poisonous atmosphere with the sick, wiser counsels on this occasion
prevailed, and more humane measures were adopted. On the advice of Dr
Rae, Inspector of the Royal Naval Hospital, the sick, twelve in number, were
immediately removed to that establishment, and of these two died, without any
communication of the disease.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As already stated, official inquiries were directed to be
made into the causes of this extraordinary mortality, from
which it appears:—</p>

<p class='c008'>That there was nothing peculiar in the disease itself.
The medical and other officers of the ship, as well as the
medical and other officers at Boa Vista, that is, all competent
witnesses who actually saw the disease, concur
in stating that it was nothing more than an aggravated
form of the common endemic fever of the African coast;
a view which is decisively confirmed by the original
description of the disease in the medical journal of the
ship, and by post-mortem examination.</p>

<p class='c008'>In opposition to this generally-received opinion, however,
Sir William Pym promulgated a statement that,
in addition to the common African fever, the celebrated
<i>nova pestis</i> of Dr Chisholm had been introduced into the
vessel by a passenger taken on board at Sierra Leone;
this disease being, as he represents, a fever <i>sui generis</i>,
known by the name of the African, Bulam, Yellow, or
Black Vomit Fever, attacking the human frame but once,
and differing from the common remittent fever in being
highly contagious.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>That the doctrine on which Sir William Pym’s assertion
rests met with little countenance from medical
authorities is apparent from the statement of Sir William
Burnett, who says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The whole of this, as regards the peculiar properties of
the disease, called by Sir William Pym, Bulam, &amp;c., is a
gratuitous assumption on his part, and, in my opinion, has
no foundation in fact; and in my view of this part of the
subject I am supported by nineteen-twentieths of the
medical officers of both services, who are of opinion with
myself that the more ardent form of Yellow Fever is a
mere modification of the bilious remittent so extensively
known all over the tropical regions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He adds: “The fever which prevailed in the ‘Eclair’
was unquestionably a remittent fever, originating in marsh
miasmata, and the exposure of the men in boats during
rainy weather.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr King and Dr Stewart, in official Reports upon this
case, state their concurrence with Sir William Burnett.
Dr McWilliam, on the other hand, is of opinion that the
disease, though primarily an endemic remittent of the
African coast, became, from a series of causes, exalted into
a concentrated remittent or Yellow Fever, and in that
manner acquired new and peculiar properties, not primarily
and essentially belonging to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>With reference to this latter opinion, it may be observed
that the Governor-General of the Cape de Verd Islands
affirms, that not one of those who with a view to escape
the pestilence emigrated to the different islands of the
Archipelago, had the disease, or communicated it to others.
According to the view of Dr McWilliam, therefore, this
disease must have been of a very singular character, for in
its origin at Shebar, it was not contagious, at Boa Vista
it became contagious, while in the other islands of the
Archipelago, wherever the sick or the uninfected fled, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>again laid aside its contagious character, and did not
spread to a single individual.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the inquirers and reporters agree in stating that
among the causes which concurred in communicating to
this disease so extraordinary a degree of prevalence and
mortality, the more important were the following:—</p>

<p class='c008'>The employment of the crew uninterruptedly for an
unusual length of time, including the sickly season, in a
peculiarly unhealthy situation, and dangerous local duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exposure of men, whose systems were impregnated
with the seeds of disease imbibed in this unhealthy
locality, to the risks of unrestricted liberty on shore, in the
atmosphere of Sierra Leone, during the rainy season; one
consequence of which freedom being their “inordinate indulgence
in ardent spirits of the worst description.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And subsequently, at Boa Vista, the confinement of the
crew, the sick as well as the uninfected, in a place still
more crowded, filthy, and unventilated than their quarters
on board, instead of their dispersion in a pure atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some conception may be formed of the unfavourable
circumstances under which the crew were placed at the
Fort, from the account which, on personal inspection, Dr
King gives of its sanitary condition, who states that from
the absence of all means of cleansing, from the actual accumulation
of filth, and from the impossibility under any
circumstances of obtaining a free circulation of pure air,
owing to the plan of the building, the atmosphere which
the sick, the convalescent, and the healthy were compelled
to breathe, day and night, must have been polluted and
deleterious in the extreme; and that into a space incapable
of affording sufficient accommodation for 50 men, upwards of
100, including the sick, were huddled together under a
most oppressive heat, the thermometer ranging from 81°
to 86°. This description is confirmed by the testimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of Dr Almeida, who states that having been requested by
the Governor-General to go to the Fort and see the sick,
“he found them so extremely crowded that he could hardly
pass between them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The influence of such conditions in conducing to the
virulence and spread of the disease has been already
exemplified in what has been stated under the head
“Localizing Causes;” but it must be added, that the
crew had here also access to ardent spirits, in which both
the sick and the uninfected indulged to still greater excess
even than at Sierra Leone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is with great regret,” says Sir William Burnett,
“I have now to state on the best information, that while in
this situation means were found to supply the sick as well
as others with enormous quantities of ardent spirits, which
were drunk with avidity and produced the most deleterious
effects; indeed, I have reason to believe that some were
absolutely killed by it as if by poison. Had there not
been a fever already in existence, the intense heat (86° of
Fahrenheit), the nature of the soil, and this dreadful intoxication
together, would have been fully sufficient to have
produced it, and one of the worst kind too, in which
irritability of the stomach and dark-coloured vomiting
would have been conspicuous symptoms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The actual result, as stated by Dr McWilliam, was that
the accession to the sick-list and the mortality became
much greater at this time than they had been at any previous
period, and that from an endemic remittent of the
African coast, the disease became exalted into a concentrated
remittent or Yellow Fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indubitable evidence further shows that, in addition to
all these causes of disease, the crew when on board were
constantly inhaling a poison generated in the ship itself.
On a superficial examination the ship may have appeared
clean, and Sir William Pym positively asserts that she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>so; but there is conclusive evidence that this appearance
was fallacious.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the records of the Medical Department of the
Navy have been extracted the following decisive statement
with reference to this point, by Captain Simpson, late of
the “Rolla:”—</p>

<p class='c008'>“In June, 1845, being then in command of the ‘Rolla,’
I went on board the ‘Eclair’ off Shebar River. Commander
Estcourt reported to me that he had sent a boat
up the Sherborough River, and that the crew, during
night, were exposed to heavy rain and much lightning, and
were sick: some deaths had occurred on board. In the
early part of July I went to Sierra Leone for supplies; the
‘Eclair’ was there; the vessel was anchored close to the
shore; and I advised her Commander to move her further
out, which he did. There seemed much excitement
amongst the crew; some liberty had been given them, and
drunkenness and sickness were the consequence. Wood
was received on board for fuel in lieu of coals. This wood
was green, as I understood at Sierra Leone, and very unhealthy
to burn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This fact is substantiated by the log of the “Eclair,”
which shows that from July 16th to the 19th inclusive, the
crew were employed at Sierra Leone in wooding.</p>

<p class='c008'>The influence of a quantity of greenwood recently taken
on board a ship navigating the tropical seas, in producing
destructive fever, is shown in the most striking manner by
the history of the “Regalia,” and by that of the “Vestal.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c005'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f33'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For these cases see the Second Report on Quarantine, pp. 64, 299.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Further evidence will be found in the Medical Department
of the Navy to show “that the hold of the ‘Eclair’
was in a pestiferous state;” and Dr King states, that long
after the people left the ship in England, and when the
engines were removed, mud, some inches deep, was found
under the flooring.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“I should scarcely have noticed the above circumstance,”
he says, “but for some remarkable occurrences which took
place in the same vessel at a subsequent period, which
confirmed me in the opinion I had previously formed that
the origin and continuance of the fever on board depended
solely on local causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ‘Rosamond,’ formerly the ‘Eclair,’ was commissioned
at Woolwich on the 5th of November, 1846, for
the Cape of Good Hope station, but none of the former
crew rejoined the ship. During the time of fitting out,
four cases of typhus fever occurred, and were sent to the
hospital, where two of them died, but it is necessary to
mention that typhus was prevalent at Woolwich at the time.
The steamer left England for the Cape on the 23rd of
February, 1847. Three days after sailing, one of the men
was affected with slight febrile symptoms, and he continued
more or less indisposed for a number of days, but occasionally
felt so well that he returned to his work. After the
ship entered the tropics, however, the disease began to
assume a new and alarming character; and when off the
Island of St Nicholas, and almost in sight of Boa Vista,
the man died, having had for two days previous black
vomit and other characteristic symptoms of Yellow Fever.
Within a few days afterwards the ‘Rosamond’ arrived at
Ascension, where I was then stationed; and Commander
Foot having communicated to Captain Hutton, the superintendent
of the island, every particular respecting the
illness and death of the seaman, I was ordered, with Dr
Sloane, the surgeon of the hospital, to make a report on
the case, and at the same time to suggest measures for the
benefit of the ship without endangering the health of the
people on the island. Having obtained from Dr Slight,
surgeon of the ‘Rosamond,’ every information relative to
his late patient, we stated our opinion that the disease the
man died from was sporadic Yellow Fever. * * * On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>following morning I went on board with the view of learning
something to enable me to form an opinion as to the
sanitary condition of the ship, and for the purpose also of inspecting
the sick, as the surgeon informed me he had then
a suspicious case, with symptoms of a low kind of fever.
I had barely time to take a cursory view of the after parts
of the ship, when my attention was called to the patients,
who were all mustered in the steerage, and I found the man
the doctor had alluded to in such a precarious state that I
recommended him to be sent on shore immediately. The
only other severe case was that of a supernumary lad, who
was taken ill the same morning, but the indications of a
low malignant fever were so apparent even at that early
stage, as to induce me to express my opinion to the surgeon
that he would not probably survive 24 hours. As it was
most desirable to prevent a panic among the ship’s company,
I went on shore to consult with Captain Hutton, and
make arrangements for their reception. * * * The
patients themselves attributed their illness to foul air in
the forepart of the ship; one of them said he suffered so
much from an abominable stench in the boatswain’s storeroom,
that he represented the circumstance and obtained
permission to cut a hole in the floor, which exposed to view
a considerable quantity of soft mud, and five or six buckets
full of it mixed with decayed shavings, and emitting an
offensive odour, were removed at the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It appears then, that besides an unusual number
sleeping in the fore-cockpit, some of them at least had been
exposed to a morbific miasma, exhaled from a festering
mass of filth in the bottom of that part of the ship. The
quantity of mud, no doubt, was small in comparison
with what had accumulated when the vessel arrived at
Spithead from the coast of Africa, yet the malaria eliminated
from that small and circumscribed focus was equally
virulent in its operation, and produced the same disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>in a few who were placed within the sphere of its influence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is a brief narrative of the circumstances connected
with this ship and her crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it has been alleged that while the landing of the
crew of the “Eclair,” at Boa Vista, afforded no benefit
to the ship’s company, it inflicted a grievous evil on the
inhabitants of the island; that several individuals in contact,
or close proximity with the sick, became affected with
the same kind of fever; that from these individuals the
malady spread to others with whom they came in contact,
and from these again to others, as from so many centres of
contagion, until the disease became general over the island,
thus affording a positive instance of the importation
of epidemic disease. The alleged facts on which these representations
rest are the following:—</p>

<p class='c008'>It is stated, that during the occupancy of the Fort by
the crew, there was a small Portuguese guard stationed
there; that this guard was several times relieved; that
at the time when the “Eclair” left the island, the guard
consisted of one negro and two European soldiers; that
within three days after the sailing of the “Eclair” both
Europeans were attacked with fever similar to that from
which the crew of the “Eclair” had suffered; that the
negro soldier, who, with his comrade—the man sent
from Boa Vista to nurse the two Europeans—on returning
from the small island to Porto Sal Rey, had been—“as
a matter of precaution”—“restricted for [‘about 8’ or]
17 days to the occupation of a small hut at the northern
end” of the town, was afterwards attacked,—though not
confined to bed until the day following his return to barracks;
and that a woman (Anna Gallinha), who lived next
door to this hut, was the first person who was attacked
with fever in the town. It is further stated that a man
(Pathi), who had been a labourer on board the “Eclair,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>was also attacked with fever, according to one account,
on the day after the “Eclair” sailed; but according
to another account, on the third day after that
event.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such are the alleged facts, and the only ones bearing
directly on the communication of a specific contagion by
the crew of the “Eclair,” collected by Dr M‘William by
personal inquiries on the spot; and these, in his opinion,
present a chain of evidence sufficient to establish a positive
instance of the importation of epidemic disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>With reference, however, to these inquiries, it has been
already stated that they were not instituted until several
months after the departure of the “Eclair” from Boa
Vista;—the only regular practitioner on the island (Dr
Kenny) who could have given authentic and trustworthy
information respecting the nature and progress of the
disease, had died;—the witnesses examined by Dr
M‘William, poor and ignorant, gave their evidence, hearsay
and otherwise, in the loosest possible manner;—their
statements as to dates and occurrences, alleged to have
happened several months before the inquiry took place,
were received implicitly, without examination into the
correctness of their answers and the credibility of their
testimony;—all the witnesses of this class appear to have
spoken under the influence of the strongest feeling of self-interest,
with a view to establish a claim to pecuniary compensation
should they be able to make out a case against
the “Eclair,” in which expectation they were not disappointed,
since the sum of £1000 was eventually granted by
Great Britain for the benefit of the inhabitants;—and to
this motive may probably be ascribed the highly coloured
and exaggerated statements put forth by these people on
the re-appearance of fever in the following year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking the facts, however, precisely as they are represented
in the Report of Dr M‘William, they do not, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>proof of the allegation in question requires, present a clear
and palpable chain of evidence, connecting as cause and
effect the fever of the ship with the epidemic on shore;
but, on the contrary, there is not a single link undoubtedly
connecting the one with the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take the first case forming what is represented as the
first link in this presumed chain, the seizure with fever of
the two guards at the Fort. Two European soldiers lately
arrived in the colony, and therefore peculiarly predisposed
to an attack of endemic fever, go from Boa Vista, which
at that time was healthy, to a confined, unventilated, overcrowded,
and filthy spot on another island, where fever was
raging to such a degree that within the space of three
weeks there had occurred no less than 60 attacks and 33
deaths, in a crew consisting on the arrival of the ship of
117 officers and men. There is in this no evidence of the
propagation of disease by a specific contagion; on the
contrary, it is the ordinary production of disease by its
ordinary cause, namely, exposure to a polluted atmosphere,
the pollution being, in this instance, excessive from overcrowding;
from accumulation of filth; from foul and
offensive privies; from the impossibility of the admission
of fresh air, owing to the construction of the building, and
from the intense and oppressive heat, the thermometer
ranging from 81° to 86° of Fahrenheit. The seizure of two
men with fever under such circumstances is precisely
analogous to the attack of persons, previously healthy,
with typhus, who take up their abode in the crowded and
filthy courts and alleys of English towns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take the next link in the chain, the attack of the negro
soldier. The circumstances respecting this man, being
precisely the same as those relating to the two other guards,
the same answer would have sufficed for both, but according
to the testimony of the man himself, his illness was very
slight, and his companion who was sent to lodge with him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>at the hut in Porto Sal Rey, had no illness at all during
the whole time of their seclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third link in the chain is the presumed fact, that a
woman (Anna Gallinha), who lived next door to the hut
in which these two men had been confined, was seized
with fever soon after they had left it, and that she was the
first person attacked, at least whose illness attracted public
attention, in the town of Porto Sal Rey. Dr King states,
that on a personal examination of the soldier who had experienced
the slight attack of fever, he said that during the
seventeen days that he and his companion were confined
to the hut, “they had no communication with any one.”
Dr M‘William, on the other hand, affirms that Gallinha
was a frequent visitor at the hut, and, indeed, cooked for
the men. Supposing Dr M‘William’s account to be the
correct one, it is surely more reasonable to attribute the
attack of Gallinha to the local causes to which she was exposed,
and which Dr M‘William admits were sufficient to
account for her illness, than to contagion derived from a
man whose illness was so slight that it had not confined
him to his bed for a single day, and which was incapable
of infecting his companion who was constantly with him
night and day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the time Anna Gallinha was taken ill,” says Dr
M‘William, “much rain had fallen; the weather had become
more hot, and, in short, there now (but not before
this) existed the recognized elements for malarious evolution.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In that part of the town called Beira, or Pao de
Varella,” reports Dr King, “where Anna Gallinha and the
soldiers resided, the houses are of the lowest description,
and the people who occupy them are generally very poor
and destitute; there is a large pool of stagnant salt and
fresh water immediately behind; but to windward of this
part of the town, and still nearer to the houses, there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>locality which is resorted to by many of the people when
obeying the calls of nature; and the exhalations from the
one, and the effluvia from the other, are blown by the north
winds in the direction of Beira.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A similar description of this locality is given by Dr
M‘William,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the upper portion of the town,” he says, “which is
called Pao de Varella, the houses are in general mere
hovels, rudely built, and much crowded together, and with
few exceptions dirty. They are occupied by the lowest
classes. From the total absence of any police laws the
streets here are also very filthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here then were present in full force, as is admitted, the
ordinary localizing causes of fever; to which it is more
consistent to refer this case, than to an extraordinary
and foreign cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at this point the presumed chain of evidence stops;
the chain is suddenly snapped; there is no further link
traceable; there is nothing really connecting the illness of
Gallinha with the next cases, or with the general spread of
the disease which rapidly followed, and we need hardly
state, that in order to prove the spread of a pestilence
by contagion, communication, either direct or indirect,
must be proved to have existed between all the persons
attacked.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c005'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f34'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r34'>34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The widow of the next victim (Affonso) denied his having had communication
with Gallinha; and Dr Almeida “found about 20 people sick” in Porto
Sal Rey only three or four days after Gallinha’s death. It is evidently more rational
to ascribe these numerous attacks to epidemic influence, which it is admitted
was now present, than to contact with this woman, for the fact of which there
is in truth not a shadow of evidence.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For the only other case of fever that is stated to have
occurred shortly after the sailing of the “Eclair,” namely,
that of the labourer (Pathi) who had been employed on
board the ship, will scarcely be considered as affording an
additional link; since admitting that this man contracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>his fever while employed on board the “Eclair,” his case
would be merely one of infection from going on board a
foul ship, a generally recognized cause of fever:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whenever,” says Dr Stewart, “fever has prevailed
much in ships on the West India and African stations,
strangers going on board of those ships have been particularly
liable to its attack; but on sending fever cases from
those ships to the hospitals and private houses on shore,
it has not been found that the disease extended from
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But as in the locality of the dwelling of Gallinha, so in
the district in which this man lived, there were local causes
abundantly sufficient to account for the endemic origin of
his disease. He resided in Rabil, one of the hamlets in the
neighbourhood of Moradinha, at some distance from Porto
Sal Rey. Of this locality Dr King says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“If there is one spot more than another in the whole
island where, from its physical peculiarities, endemic fever
might be expected to begin first, and end last, that locality
is Moradinha, and the villages in its vicinity, in one of
which Pathi resided.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be observed further, that whatever may have
been the cause of this man’s fever, it is admitted, that for
three weeks at least it was communicated to no one else in
the house at Moradinha, where he was attacked, and remained
for eight days, and not to any one else in that
neighbourhood for 11 weeks; that his illness was extremely
slight, and that on his return to his own house no disease
broke out for some time in his family. According to Dr
M‘William, the first member of his family that was attacked
was one of his children, who was taken ill “on the tenth
or eleventh day” after his return, the illness of this child
being gradually followed by that of two other children.
But Dr King affirms that these children were not taken ill
until “about a month” after their father’s return, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>that it was not until the succeeding month (the middle of
November) that his wife was seized, “when the disease
was general throughout the island.” It is also particularly
to be observed, that a child in another family at
Rabil, having no communication with the family of Pathi,
died about the same time as Pathi’s first child, and that
the disease broke out at least as early at Rabil as at Porto
Sal Rey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, it may be urged in opposition to the opinion
that the contagion was communicated by the crew of the
“Eclair,” that the small island on which the sick were
landed and to which they were confined was a mile distant
from the town of Porto Sal Rey, and that on reference to
the map attached to Dr M‘William’s report, it is obvious
that the North-east trade wind must (according to the
theory of Sir William Pym, as applied to the Neutral
Ground at Gibraltar in 1828) have dispersed the contagion
if in existence, or carried it in a contrary direction from
Porto Sal Rey.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>For a more minute examination of the cases of the guards
at the Fort, and of Pathi and others, as presented by
Dr M‘William, we refer to the Note of Dr Browne, Appendix
No. III. (p. 306),<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c005'><sup>[35]</sup></a> who has there shown the real value
of these cases, considered as links forming a chain of circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f35'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Vide</i> the Report itself.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The authentic facts attending the intercourse of the
ship’s company with the inhabitants of the island, afford
further evidence that no infection could have been communicated
by the former to the latter. Thus, it is admitted
that Captain Estcourt, the commander of the ship, went
directly from the infected vessel to reside with Mr Macaulay,
the judge: no infection was communicated to Mr
Macaulay, or any part of his family.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The officers of the gun-room—midshipmen, warrant, and
engineer—on disembarking from the ship, took a house
for themselves and their servants in the town, and mixed
unreservedly with the inhabitants: no infection was communicated
to any individual with whom they had intercourse.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crew obtained or took leave to pay frequent visits
from the small island to the town of Porto Sal Rey, where,
according to Dr M‘William, they resorted chiefly to the
house of one Georgio, who kept a spirit store; the only
consequence of which visit, considered by Dr M‘William a
remarkable one, appears to have been that this man (and
“shortly afterwards” two females who associated with
them) was attacked with headache and general fever on
the evening of the day he was visited by the “Eclair’s”
people; a result which admits of a more obvious solution
than the communication of febrile contagion on the part of
persons who were themselves in perfect health.</p>

<p class='c008'>The soiled linen of the officers and crew having been
brought on shore on the first arrival of the vessel, was immediately
given out to be washed to the washerwomen of
Porto Sal Rey, and the careful search made after these
women, brought to light no fewer than seventeen persons
who were so employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The soiled clothes,” says Dr King, “linen, cotton, and
flannel, which had accumulated in the officers’ cabin from
the time of their departure from Sierra Leone, were contained
in at least 12 bags, which were taken on shore at
Porto Sal Rey the same evening the ship arrived, and distributed
next morning (22nd August) to the washerwomen
of the town. Now, if the disease possesses the power of
reproduction, its poison must [according to general opinion]
have been as certainly communicated through the medium
of <i>fomites</i> as by direct contact with the sick on board or at
the fort; yet none of the washerwomen nor any in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>families were attacked with fever until November, showing
an interval of 70 days after exposure to the infection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That it was not from any want of susceptibility to the
influence of febrile poison that these women escaped the
danger of this exposure to <i>fomites</i> was proved by subsequent
events; for during the progress of the epidemic, all
of these women, according to Dr McWilliam, with only one
exception, were attacked with the prevailing fever; two
between six and seven weeks after the sailing of the
“Eclair;” five, two months; two, three months; three,
four months; and one, five months afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>“None of the deaths,” says Dr M‘William, “took place
until fever was general in Porto Sal Rey, so that in none
of these cases can the occurrence of the fever be fairly attributed
to infectious matter conveyed by the linen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Guards at the Fort were many times relieved, and
the soldiers were sent direct from the small island to their
barracks in Porto Sal Rey, without conveying any disease
to their comrades. On one occasion two soldiers who are
stated to have lived in a room next to that in which the
sick of the “Eclair” were lodged, on being taken ill, were
conveyed at once to the barracks, yet they infected no one
in their quarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>From a list drawn up by Dr King, of the names of the
islanders who were engaged as labourers on board the
“Eclair,” it appears that there were in all 63 persons employed
in coaling, watering, and cleansing the ship. These
men appear to have had unrestricted communication with
the ship’s crew. According to Dr M‘William, the whole
of these labourers went to their respective homes every
night, except those from Estacia and the Eastern villages,
who generally slept at Porto Sal Rey. None of these men
were themselves attacked with fever, excepting one (Pathi)
whose case has been already considered; none of them
communicated fever either to their own families or to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>persons with whom they lodged in the town, yet subsequent
events proved that they as well as the washerwomen
were sufficiently susceptible subjects, since, during the
progress of the epidemic, the greater part of them were
attacked by the disease; none, however, within a month
after the departure of the “Eclair;” a few within two
months, but the majority not until four or five months
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the geographical position of the Cape de Verd
Islands places them within the legitimate domain of Yellow
Fever, and that this disease is no stranger to these islands,
is admitted on all hands. According to Dr M‘William,</p>

<p class='c008'>“The north-western part of the island, where Porto Sal
Rey is situated, is low and flat, and almost wholly occupied
by sand, which, blown up from the north-western shore
through the water-courses, and other hollows, accumulates
in mounds twenty and thirty feet high, which are drawn
about and shifted by any little variation of the direction of
the wind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the flat between Porto Sal Rey and the village of
Rabil, which is about four miles to the southward of Porto
Sal Rey, Dr M‘William states that there is a point where
the sea, when the waves are high—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Breaks over the elevated beach, and penetrates through
the shingle, so as to accumulate, and run inland in the form
of a narrow creek, from 200 to 300 yards from the sea-shore.
During the rainy season, this, in common with the other
flats on the island, is inundated to a considerable extent,
as is evident from the appearance of the soil in those places
not covered with sand, as well as by the presence of a rude
raised causeway, which the people have constructed over
part of the hollow flat, to render it passable during the
rains. * * * Near the town is a hollow flat, spread
over an area of about a mile, with the same soil and subsoil
as that in the town. The central part of this area is occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>by a salt pan, which contains not less than 300 troughs,
each a foot deep, and about thirty feet square, into which
the salt water is poured, there to evaporate and form salt.
During and for some weeks after the rainy season, the
whole of this space is more or less inundated. * * * The
water is left to stagnate on the Rabil side, and as it dries
up during the hot weather, little alluvial islets are from
time to time exposed, which the people avail themselves of
to raise a small crop of corn. Indeed the greater part of
the ravine, from Rabil downwards, is in a state of rude
cultivation, and contains large green fœtid pools, with all
kinds of decomposing matter, the effluvia from which was
most offensive when I was there in May, 1846.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Experience has shown, that such a condition of sandy
soil is as fruitful a source of endemic and malignant fever
as a marsh or swamp. Dr Lind, who wrote nearly a century
ago, expressly notices the unhealthiness of Boa Vista,
particularly during the rainy season, stating that,
“strangers who arrive here at this season are liable to be
visited by a general sickness,” and instances its white sand
as a mark of an unhealthy locality. Dr Fergusson confirms
the correctness of this indication of insalubrity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That sandy soils,” he says, “should, in malarious
climates, prove as productive of aggravated remittent fever
as the swamp, has never been sufficiently explained. Certain
it is, however, that they do so, in a marked and prominent
degree. The Alemtejo and Algarve of Portugal—regions,
I may say, altogether of sand—are the most prolific of
fever of any in the Peninsula.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another instance is found in the unhealthiness of Vera
Cruz, which is spoken of by McCulloch in the following
words:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is said to be the original seat of the Yellow Fever.”
[Bulama?] “The city is well built and the streets clean,
but it is surrounded by sand-hills and ponds of stagnant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>water, which, within the tropics, are quite enough to generate
disease. The inhabitants and those accustomed to
the climate are not subject to this formidable disease; but
all strangers, even those from the Havannah and the West
India Islands are liable to the infection. No precautions
can prevent its attack, and many have died at Xalapa, on
the road to Mexico, who merely passed through this pestilential
spot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr King states, that if ever endemic fever derives its
origin from a vitiated and malarious state of the atmosphere,
Boa Vista abounds with the elements for its production.
Among these he enumerates swamps and pools of
stagnant water, in the immediate vicinity of Porto Sal Rey,
and over the whole district of Rabil; patches of rich alluvial
soil near the other villages, the recognized sources of
noxious exhalations; the wretched food of the lower
classes, and still more, the polluted atmosphere which they
breathe in their crowded and ill-ventilated abodes, and
the general disregard of cleanliness in their houses and
streets, “a combination of morbid causes,” he says, “which
would produce malignant fevers in any part of the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The relative position of Boa Vista to the African coast
would further naturally lead to the expectation that it must
be subject to diseases of the same character, and no one
disputes that this is the case. The residents of the island,
military, medical, and civil, concur in stating that endemic,
bilious remittent fever, prevails there more or less every
year; that there is no season in which it does not carry
off several of the inhabitants, and that it often prevails
epidemically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The testimony of the most intelligent men in the
island,” says Dr King, “including Dr Almeida, Senor
Baptista (the Consul’s agent), the Mayor of Rabil, the Judge
of Fundas Figieras, and the Judge at Old Town, removes
every doubt as to the fact that fever prevails to a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>extent, and carries off several of the inhabitants in the
months of November and December every year; and this
endemic fever, which recurs annually, and which Dr
Almeida calls the bilious remittent, does not always present
the same mild aspect and character; on the contrary, it is
well known that in certain years the disease was epidemical,
and in comparison with other seasons, very fatal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr M‘William records the fact, that such epidemic
seasons occurred and proved unusually mortal in the years
1821–2, in 1827, and in 1833.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is most material to a right understanding of this whole
subject to observe, that a Yellow Fever Epidemic had
broken out at this very time in an adjoining island, St Jago.
It is stated by Dr Stewart, in his Report in the Admiralty
Correspondence, that “in the adjoining island at Porto
Praya, there was Yellow Fever whilst the ship was at Boa
Vista.” Captain Simpson states that it recurred in the
following year at Porto Praya; “is common there at times
and quite endemic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That co-incident with the presence of the “Eclair” at
Boa Vista one of these epidemic seasons was impending,
was declared by the usual indications, which in warm
climates precede and accompany such visitations. These
premonitory signs on this occasion were a great fall of rain
at an unaccustomed season; the consequent accumulation
of large quantities of stagnant water in and about the towns
and villages; the occurrence of extraordinary heat; the
prevalence of light winds with frequent calms rendering
the weather extremely sultry and oppressive; the appearance
of sporadic cases of fever of more than common intensity;
the almost simultaneous outbreak of pestilence
amongst cattle and other domestic animals; and the visitation
in greater numbers than common of destructive
insects.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c005'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f36'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See note, p. 16.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>These prognostications were so manifest as to excite
the attention and alarm of the intelligent classes of residents.
The Governor-General states:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great falls of rain took place at a very advanced period
of the season, which remained stagnant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The British Consul says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Up to the month of October, extraordinary heat and
the fall of a large quantity of rain had been experienced,
events which were surprising to the oldest inhabitants.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The British Judge says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stagnant water had settled in great quantity at the
back of the town, to which was joined great heat in the
weather.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr King says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The information received on the island in 1846, fully
corroborated what is stated in the above extracts, the
periodical rains, contrary to what usually happens, did not
set in till late in September. In October, November, and
December the winds were light and variable, with frequent
calms, and the weather became in consequence extremely
sultry and oppressive. The grass and green crops were
nearly destroyed by the long previous drought, and what
little appeared after the rains was devoured by the locusts,
which visited the island in greater numbers this year than
was ever known to be the case before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Though Dr M‘William, on his inspection of the island
with a view to ascertain the true cause of the pestilence,
took no notice of any of these premonitory signs of its
approach, Sir William Burnett was fully aware of their
signification, and calls special attention to one of the most
important of them in his Report to the Lords of the
Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I beg to lay before their Lordships,” he says, “an
extract of a letter from the Governor-General of the Cape
de Verd Islands, and likewise extracts of letters from Mr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Macaulay and the British Consul, residents on the island of
Boa Vista, distinctly showing the very remarkable state of
the weather preceding the attack of the inhabitants of the
island, which very important circumstance in a case of this
kind I regret to observe Dr M‘William has omitted to
take any particular notice of.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The event foreshadowed by these occurrences rapidly
followed. As early as the middle of September a few
cases of unusually malignant fever broke out, but, as has
been already stated, the first case that attracted public
attention occurred on the 12th of October; a few others
followed during the remainder of this month; a still
greater number broke out in the beginning of November,
and the epidemic came to its height in the latter half of
November, continuing to prevail throughout December,
and recurring for several months in the following
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>As in epidemic outbreaks in general, so in this instance,
individual or sporadic cases occurred some time before the
appearance of the epidemic in its true and proper form.
On minute inquiry, it was discovered that one if not two
cases occurred as early as the 14th of September (Pathi),
another on the 20th of September (Roque), and a third
on the 21st of September (Agostinho): no other cases,
at least none that attracted attention, appeared to have
occurred until the one already mentioned (Gallinha), on
the 12th of October. These sporadic cases all occurred in
the ordinary localities of epidemic disease, and among individuals
belonging to the classes that usually furnish its
first and chief victims.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Boa Vista, in addition to other proofs of the presence
of a stagnant and pestilential atmosphere, there was the
evidence derived from the prevalence of unusual sickness
and mortality among domestic animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That the common air,” says Dr King, “which was inhaled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>by every living thing on the island was in an
epidemic condition in the months of October, November,
and December of both years, is sufficiently demonstrated by
the simultaneous occurrence of universal sickness and great
mortality among the cattle (including horses, cows, mules,
donkeys, and goats) at the very time that fever was raging
among the inhabitants. And, further, there was this
remarkable coincidence, that after an interval of some
months and the disappearance of the disease both in man
and beast, the same fever broke out again in the towns
and villages about the rainy season of the following year,
and was again accompanied by the same murrain among
the cattle, which in the two seasons proved fatal to two-thirds
of the whole stock of the island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These considerations afford all the evidence which the
nature of the case admits of, that the sickness which
affected the island on this occasion arose, not from the
landing of the sick of the “Eclair,” but from climatic and
endemic causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>To sum up the whole of this case, then, it appears
that the evidence in favour of the allegation that fever
was imported into Boa Vista by the “Eclair,” amounts to
this: that four men, not of the ship’s crew, were attacked
with fever while performing military service in a locality
in which no fewer than 60 of the crew themselves were
seized; that one man not of the ship’s crew who worked
as a labourer on board the ship “about eight” or “two”
days, had a slight attack of fever, while 62 men also not
of the ship’s crew, and who also in like manner worked
as labourers on board the ship a longer time, were wholly
unaffected; and that a month after the sailing of the
vessel, a woman was attacked with fever who happened to
be a next-door neighbour to two of the soldiers who had
served on duty at the Fort—one of whom was unaffected,
and the other not even confined to bed—simultaneously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>with the children of the labourer (Pathi) who resided in
one of the dirtiest localities of the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>Against such evidence, if evidence it can be called, must
be weighed the following countervailing considerations:—</p>

<p class='c008'>It is admitted that the “Eclair” had been exposed on
the coast of Africa to the causes which usually develope
epidemic fever in that country; that intensity was given
to those causes by circumstances which occurred at Sierra
Leone, where she took in green wood as fuel, and where
her men went on shore during the rainy and sickly
season, and indulged in the unlimited use of ardent
spirits; that her hold was in a pestiferous condition, and
that a quantity of putrid mud had collected between her
timbers. It is proved that the fever which broke out
under these circumstances was the common endemic
African coast fever, which, it is admitted, is not contagious,
and which is assumed to have become contagious
on this particular occasion, expressly to account for its
alleged importation. It is admitted that on the landing
of the ship’s crew at Boa Vista, though the men mixed
freely with the islanders,—though the officers lodged in
the town,—and though, when some of them became sick,
they were nursed by the inhabitants,—there was no communication
of the disease in a single instance. It is
admitted that of seventeen washerwomen who washed the
linen of the officers and crew, not one became infected,
although all these women, except two, suffered severely
from the disease at subsequent periods after the epidemic
became general. It is admitted that with the exception
of one case, which has been proved on inquiry to have
been no real exception, 87<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c005'><sup>[37]</sup></a> labourers worked on board or
in the neighbourhood of the ship daily, and returned to
their homes at night, without taking any precautions,—without
becoming themselves infected,—and without communicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>infection to any individual of their families;—though,
like the washerwomen, the greater part of these
men suffered severely when the epidemic became general.
It is admitted that the Cape de Verde Islands are within
the Yellow Fever zone, and are liable to frequent and
severe outbreaks of epidemic fever. It is admitted that
the physical and social conditions of Boa Vista are eminently
those which are found by universal experience to
localize epidemic diseases whenever an epidemic influence
is present. It is admitted that the “Eclair” arrived at
Boa Vista at the season of the year when endemic fevers
usually prevail. It is admitted that at the very time of
her arrival, Yellow Fever was actually prevailing at Porto
Praya, in the island of St Jago, into which it is not alleged
that the disease had been introduced by importation. It
is admitted that some time before the outbreak of the epidemic,
the atmospheric and other conditions which usually
precede and accompany the development of epidemic disease,
were so manifest as to attract general attention. It
is proved that sporadic cases of the disease appeared, as
is usual, some time before the presence of the epidemic
was declared in its distinct and recognized form. It is
admitted that the epidemic influence extended to animals
as well as man, a mortal epizootic disease prevailing over
the whole of the island at the same time. It is proved
that the epidemic did not break out until about a month
or six weeks after the “Eclair,” with all her crew, healthy
and sick, had left the island. It is admitted that a
similar epidemic appeared among men and animals
the following year, not imported, but entirely of local
origin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The aggregate number of the lists furnished by Dr M‘William.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A consideration of these circumstances has satisfied most
of those who have inquired into the case, that the arrival
of the “Eclair” at Boa Vista with fever among her crew,
and the occurrence of a similar disease on the island,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>were mere coincident events, and that the appearances
which might at first view have given some colour to the
notion of importation were fallacious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among those who arrived at these conclusions were—The
Governor-General, who says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The disease was perfectly endemic. Not one of those
who emigrated to the different islands of the Archipelago
had the disease or communicated it to others. It did not
make its appearance till a month after the departure of the
steamer.... The disease had its origin in the great
falls of rain which took place at a very advanced period of
the season, and which remained stagnant in the neighbourhood
of the place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Rendall, the Consul, who says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The competent officers of the ‘Eclair’ at all times
pleaded that the fever which had appeared and rested on
board was nothing more than the ‘common African coast
fever;’ the opinion of the medical men on the spot continued
to be that the fever was merely the common
African fever, and that no danger existed of its spreading
among the people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Macaulay, the Judge, who says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long an interval had elapsed between the departure
of the ‘Eclair’ and the appearance of the first serious case
of fever in the town, that we were all disposed in the first
instance to attribute it, as well as the general sickness of
the place, rather to stagnant water, which had settled in
great quantity at the back of the town, joined with the
great heat of the weather and the dirty state of the streets.
The ‘Eclair’ had left Boa Vista nearly a month before any
case of fever exhibited itself in the town.... No injury
whatever had resulted from the unrestricted intercourse
which had subsisted during the whole of the
‘Eclair’s’ stay in the harbour, between the officers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>men (not in the hospital at the fort) and their friends on
shore.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Simpson, who says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I give my opinion on the fever that was on board
the ‘Eclair,’ I should say it commenced at Shebar: and
it was to be expected that men being exposed in boats to
night duty during the rains, would be sickly; that it was
likely to be much increased at Sierra Leone by the long
continuance of the vessel there, and the men having leave
to go on shore during this season, when this place is so
very unhealthy, and seamen always so incautious; the occupation
of the ‘Eclair’s’ officers and ship’s company on
board the ‘Albert’ in clearing the holds, at all times a
very dangerous work in the Tropics; and the use of green
wood for fuel. In fact, I should have been very much surprised
if the ‘Eclair’ had not been sickly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir William Burnett, who, in reporting on the case to
the Lords of the Admiralty, says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“After a careful perusal of the papers he (Dr M‘William)
has sent, I am compelled to say that I cannot conscientiously
arrive at the conclusion the Doctor has done, namely,
that the fever was occasioned by intercourse with the
‘Eclair.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir William Burnett adds, with reference to the general
question of importation:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“With respect to the importation of the disease into
various places, except in one instance, and that even is
surrounded with doubts (I mean that of Her Majesty’s
sloop ‘Bann’), I entirely disbelieve it. Both the surgeons
of Bermuda Hospital most distinctly deny on two
occasions that the epidemic which prevailed in 1843 was
imported or contagious; I have also caused the medical
reports of Jamaica Hospital for more than twenty years to
be examined; and though hundreds of patients with yellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>fever in all its most appalling forms, including black
vomit, &amp;c., have been treated in that establishment, not
one of the medical officers in charge of the hospital have
ever hinted at the disease being contagious; and if it be
needful I can cite numerous other instances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the apprehension that the crew of the “Eclair”
might have imported the disease into England, he says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have no hesitation in declaring my firm belief that
the sick men of the ‘Eclair’ when that ship arrived at the
Motherbank, might have been landed at Haslar Hospital
and placed in the well-ventilated wards of that establishment
without the public health suffering in the smallest
degree. It is a fact well known, and of the truth of which
I can give the most satisfactory proof, that during the
autumn of every year merchant-ships arrive in our harbours
loaded with the produce of the coast of Africa, having
perhaps lost great part, nay in some instances the
whole, of their crew by the fever of the country; or some
are still labouring under fever when the ship arrives in
the Thames, and are sent to the hospital in that state;
yet no instance is known of any infection having been
produced by such procedure; in fact it is perfectly certain
that it never did take place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr King, who says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The inhabitants in general are firmly persuaded that
the fever was imported by the ‘Eclair’ and afterwards
spread throughout the island by contagion from one person
to another. I have taken considerable pains to trace out
and discover the supposed morbid concatenation, but in
vain. It becomes, therefore, a duty to express my opinion
decidedly, that there is no satisfactory proof of the disease
having been propagated by contagion, or from a specific
poison which is said to emanate from the bodies of the
sick, the dying, or the dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The case of the “Eclair,” as has been already stated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>is the one on which the greatest reliance is placed in
proof of the importation of epidemic disease.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>It is needful to advert to one instance more of alleged
importation; namely, the introduction of the Yellow Fever
epidemic of 1828 into the Garrison of Gibraltar by the
ship “Dygden.” This case has been more rigorously examined
than any other, and on that account it exhibits a
better specimen than can usually be obtained of the manner
in which the evidence for these cases is commonly got up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most positive assertions having been made that this
epidemic was introduced into Gibraltar by a ship from the
Havannah, the “Dygden,” the then Secretary of State for
the Colonies, Sir George Murray, appointed a Special
Commission to inquire into the facts of the case; consisting
of the Judge Advocate, the Colonial or Civil Secretary,
the Captain of the Port, and head of the quarantine department,
the Town Major, or head of the police, the
Principal Medical Officer of the garrison, and a Staff Surgeon.
It was the desire of Sir George Murray that the
Governor should act as president, on the ground that “as
the proposed investigation is merely to ascertain a fact, it
may be more properly accomplished by the careful examination
of impartial witnesses than by the application of
scientific research;” but Sir George Don, “not finding
himself equal to the task,” appointed, by desire of the
Secretary of State, conveyed in a subsequent despatch, the
British Superintendent of Quarantine, Sir William Pym,
to preside in his place.</p>

<p class='c008'>The facts alleged and attempted to be established before
the Board with a view to prove that this epidemic was
imported by the ship “Dygden” were, that this ship had
arrived from the Havannah with Yellow Fever on board;
that while in quarantine in the bay, she was visited
from the garrison by a family of the name of Fenic, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>that the first cases of the epidemic occurred in this
family.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first witness called to prove this alleged visit to the
ship was a woman of the name of Villalunga, who stated
that she lived in the yard of Fenic’s house; that Fenic
was a cigar-maker, that she assisted him in making cigars,
that she heard the boy (Fenic’s son) say that he, his sister,
and his father had been on board the ship in the bay on
Sunday, the day before the boy was taken ill, and that the
boy told her that they had been on board “to eat, drink,
and make merry,” and “that his father had sold tobacco
on board the ship.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next witness brought forward was a child Caffiero,
11  years old, who stated that he was in the habit of playing
with the two Fenics: that he lived very near them;
that he played with them <i>every day before their death</i>, and
that he saw them <i>every</i> day when they were sick in bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>On these statements the Judge Advocate, Mr Howell,
observes:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The only evidence which up to this period (April
10th) had been given to connect the illness in Fenic’s
family with a visit on ship-board, is the hearsay tale told by
Villalunga, nor did she give to Fenic and his two children
any companion in their alleged Sunday excursion.” * *</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eight days after his examination above mentioned, the
boy Caffiero re-appears as a witness (viz., April 18th)
with a story entirely new, and which, if credible, would be
extremely material; because he affects to speak of facts
which had before rested on the hearsay evidence of
Villalunga, but of which facts Caffiero now, after the lapse
of eight days, represents himself to have been an eye-witness.
On this his re-appearance, however, he carefully
abstains from giving any date, either day of the week, or
month, or even season of the year. This cautious avoiding
of dates may not unfairly be attributed to the variance between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>himself and Villalunga, in their respective journals
of the illness of Fenic’s children. Caffiero now says, ‘I
knew Salvo and Catalina Fenic, and went on board ship
with them; <i>I do not recollect</i> the day. We went on board
a three-masted ship. <i>I do not recollect</i> to what nation it
belonged. We remained on deck and did not go below.
We remained on board about one hour. Fenic, the father,
took us on board; he rowed the boat himself; he ate and
drank on board, and then brought <i>a bundle of clothes on
shore</i>.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Until this time, neither he nor Villalunga said anything
about a bundle of clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This boy’s second evidence thus proceeds:—‘I did not
understand the language of the people on board the ship;
they appeared to speak like Jews or Moors. I did not go
on board more than once. When we landed on the wharf,
the Maltese,’ <i>i.e.</i> Fenic, ‘<i>gave me some money, a pistoreen,
and told me not to say anything to anybody about our having
been on board</i>.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The effect which this was designed to produce is obvious,
viz., that the ship visited was in quarantine, and
Fenic, the Maltese, was conscious that he had committed
an offence against the quarantine laws which rendered it
necessary for his own safety that he should bribe this boy
to secrecy. This story is full of incongruities; it is not
probable that a man should select for his Sunday excursion,
to eat, drink, and make merry, a ship in quarantine;
it is more improbable still that Fenic should gratuitously
place himself in extreme peril, by taking with him
(to be witnesses of his offence) children of the artless ages
of 10, 11, and 13, on an expedition which, in his own
judgment, as demonstrated by his own act, he is convinced
exposes him to severe punishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But with regard to the ship ‘Dygden,’ I find that she had
already received pratique, and had been admitted to free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>intercourse with the shore, on the 6th of August, <i>four days
previously to the alleged visit of Fenic</i>, the date of which,
notwithstanding Caffiero’s loss of memory on his second
examination, had already been ascertained by Villalunga
to have been Sunday, August 10th, on which day Fenic,
therefore, could commit no crime by going on board; and
the story of the bribe and injunction to secrecy resolves
itself into a clumsy and ill-disguised attempt at giving a
colour of guilt to a fabulous occurrence which, even if it
had been real, would have been guiltless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His second evidence concludes thus:—‘My mother
was a washerwoman, and washed for a black woman who
lived next her. Fenic’s wife refused to wash the bundle
of clothes that he brought ashore; he offered them to my
mother, who also refused them; he then gave them to an
Englishwoman: I knew her: <i>she is dead: I do not know
her name, nor where she lived</i>.’ I find by my notes that he
added, ‘This occurred during last winter,’ although the
words are not entered upon the minutes. He was then
asked, ‘What season of the year was it that you were on
board of ship?’ To which he cautiously replied, ‘It was
either summer or winter, I believe.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evidence such as this, and given as I saw it given,
bears on its face every character of falsehood; and disbelieving
as I do this boy’s whole story, and at the same
time considering his extreme youth, the testimony given
by him has upon my mind the further operation of tainting
with more than suspicion all the other evidence proceeding
from the same class of witnesses, which consisted
chiefly of hearsay in conversation with persons who had
since died; because it would seem that this child must
have been an instrument in the hands of some one of
maturer age.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The suspicion attached to the second appearance of this
child is confirmed by a similar re-appearance of Villalunga,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>who, after sixteen days’ absence from the Board, on the
24th of April, again presents herself as a witness. She
now remembers that Mrs Fenic had asked her to wash
some clothes; that she did not wash them, being herself
indisposed; but that she was told by Mrs Fenic that she
put these clothes out to be washed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Howell thus comments on this second appearance of
Villalunga:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have observed that Caffiero added to his original
testimony so much as to give to it a new character altogether;
I now observe that six days after Caffiero’s
amended testimony, and sixteen days after her own original
examination, the woman Villalunga comes back with a
new story, of which, singularly enough, the principal point
is made to coincide with the alterations and emendations
in the evidence of Caffiero.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On an examination of the surviving member of the Fenic
family, the widow of Fenic himself, it appears that she
gave a positive denial to this alleged visit of her husband
and children to the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was at my desire,” says Mr Howell, “particularly
reminded that the duty which she owed to society required
her to disclose everything that she knew; and from the
ingenuous manner in which her evidence was given, I am
led to believe that she spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She declared that she did not know the cause of her
children’s illness:—‘They were attended by Dr Lopez,
who is dead, and who said they had a tabardillo and indigestion,
<i>caused by eating green figs</i>. He did not say what
was the cause of the tabardillo. My husband was a cigar-maker;
but he did not go on board ship either to buy tobacco
or to sell cigars. Neither my husband nor my
children went into the bay at any time during last summer
or autumn. I know this: because if they had gone, they
would have told me, and they did not tell me.’ Nor, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>is it to be supposed that the children would not have
told their mother, and that the husband would not have
told his wife, that which all of them are declared to have
communicated so freely to other people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On being cited before a Public Notary at Gibraltar
(November 14th, 1829), this witness still more particularly
deposed—</p>

<p class='c008'>“That it was utterly untrue that her husband went on
board any ship in the bay at any time last summer; that
on account of his age and infirmity, he had not been in a
boat for ten years past; that she is equally certain that
her two children never went on board any boat or ship;
that, with respect to the boy Caffiero, neither she nor any
of her family knew anything about him; and that his story
of having gone on board the ship with her husband and
her two children, ‘is a made-up falsehood.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Howell sums up the result of his examination of the
evidence adduced before the Board respecting the Fenic
family in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Having thus examined in detail the evidence adduced
to connect the illness of Salvador Fenic (the alleged first
case of the epidemic) with the ‘Dygden,’—and no other
vessel has been pointed at,—I find not only that it completely
fails to make out even a <i>primâ facie</i> case, but also,
from the whole complexion of the evidence, I am convinced
that the story of Fenic’s visit to that vessel on the 10th of
August is, from beginning to end, a fabrication.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Apparently in anticipation of a failure to connect the
illness in Fenic’s family with a foreign source, much testimony
was given before the Board derived, as is stated
by Mr Howell, “through channels most impure,” about
instances in which foul clothes are supposed to have been
brought ashore by sailors arriving from the Havannah, in
the early part of the epidemic, and which foul clothes infected
the washerwomen.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>After showing at some length the discrepancies and
contradictions which proved the whole testimony adduced
on this point to be utterly worthless, Mr Howell says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here I leave the journals of washerwomen, and the
tattle of their gossips, remarking this fatal objection to
each washing-tub anecdote, however circumstantial, that
<i>not one of them goes back so far as to precede</i>, and therefore
to account for, <i>the alleged first case of the epidemic</i>, namely,
that of Salvador Fenic, who, as we are told, fell ill <i>on the
11th of August</i>, and upon whose single case, therefore, the
proof of importation rests. And if the attempt to connect
the illness of Salvador Fenic with a foreign source be, as
I hold it to be, a complete failure, how is the illness of the
boy Caffiero to be accounted for? And to what is to be
ascribed the illness of Mr Martin’s child on August 16th,
a case quite as early as that of Caffiero, and which has not
been attempted to be traced to importation? not one of
the washing-tub cases being anterior either to that of Mr
Martin’s child or to that of Caffiero, both of which are unquestioned
cases of the epidemic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was essential to the proof of the connection of the
“Dygden” with the outbreak of the epidemic, to establish
the fact of the existence of Yellow Fever on board the
ship. No proof of this appears to have been adduced.
On the contrary, the captain of the ship declares that no
such disease existed on board; the head of the Quarantine
Department, after an official examination into the fact, affirms
that there is no evidence whatever to disprove the
truth of the captain’s statement, and the Quarantine Medical
Officer, after “a minute inspection of the captain
and crew,” states that he “found them all in perfect
health.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have minutely inspected the captain and crew,” he
says, “whom I found in perfect health. The reason for
putting this ship in quarantine for 40 days was, that two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>men died on the passage. It is now 66 clear days since the
first man died, and 61 since the death of the last, and
nothing like disease has since appeared, nor have I the
most distant reason to apprehend danger to the public
health from any circumstances connected with the ‘Dygden.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Howell calls special attention to this report of the
medical officer:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“This report,” he says, “was written, as it strikes me,
under circumstances which entitle it to much consideration.
This ship had been officially pointed out to him (as
the Medical Officer of Quarantine) as being strongly suspected.
The responsibility of his office was thus brought
fully before his eyes, and he had <i>then</i> no motive for making
a false report of his inspection of the ‘Dygden’s’ master
and crew, because the epidemic had not at that period
commenced. If he had observed any reasonable grounds
for suspicion, he had only to fall in with the rumour, and
recommend that none of the persons or susceptible articles
on board should be permitted to land. The conduct and
declarations, therefore, of Dr Hennen, as a responsible
public officer, under such circumstances, when, if he erred
at all, it would probably be on the side of <i>over caution</i>, I
hold to be most material.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is a fair specimen of the evidence adduced on this
occasion to establish a positive case of importation. It
breaks down at every point. There is complete failure in
the proof that Yellow Fever existed on board the ship;
there is complete failure in the proof that there was the
slightest connection between the ship and any persons on
shore; and there is even failure in the proof that the
individuals who are alleged to have introduced the disease
were really affected with a malady of the same nature as
the epidemic that subsequently prevailed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Judge Advocate thus states the conclusion at which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>he arrived after a careful examination of the proceedings
of the Commission:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am of opinion that the evidence brought forward has
totally failed to prove that the late epidemic disease was
introduced from any foreign source, either by the Swedish
ship ‘Dygden’ or by any other means; and I am further
of opinion that the late epidemic had its origin in Gibraltar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Medical observers on the spot, not members of the
Board, but who carefully watched its proceedings, it is
believed, without any exception, arrived at the same conclusion.
Thus Dr T. Smith sums up the result of his examination
of the subject in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“That it was not imported I think every candid man
will admit who has deliberately weighed the evidence
given on the subject before the Board of Commissioners,
and the facts I have stated. Every endeavour to establish
the importation doctrine has failed, and both the Colonial
Secretary, Sir George Murray, and Sir James McGrigor,
Director-General of the Army Medical Department, I have
heard, are convinced there is not the slightest ground for
such a belief; but, on the contrary, that there is every
reason to suppose the disease owed its origin to causes
within the walls of the garrison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Several comments were made by those who paid attention
to the subject at the time, on the manner in which
this investigation was conducted, which appear to deserve
notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Complaints were made that the result of the inquiry was
prejudged. In proof of this it was found that the President
of the Board, a few days before it held its first meeting,
addressed to the military secretary of the garrison an
official letter in which, among other observations directly
tending to a prejudgment of the case, he affirms, that
“the fever in question has often been traced to importation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and against this source <i>only</i> must we look for its
prevention.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears further that before the meeting of the Board
an official intimation of the views and wishes of the local
authorities was promulgated in the Government Gazette,
into which nothing is admitted but by authority, in the
following words:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The scourge from which we have been by Divine
Providence just delivered must be an exotic of some kind.
It is in its origin independent of everything inherent in
the soil which we inhabit, incapable of existing among us
during the winter months, and totally distinct from and
unconnected with the Remitting and Intermitting Fever,
which may be said to be unknown in this garrison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two causes,” observes Mr Howell, “concurred to
operate injuriously upon the proceedings of the Board:
<i>First</i>, the conviction universally prevalent among the <i>civil</i>
population of Gibraltar, that the prosperity of that community
would be undermined if it should be proved that
the epidemic had been generated on the spot, because of
the prohibitions and restrictions which it was anticipated
would in that case be inflicted upon its commercial intercourse
with other places. Hence the notion that not only
the last epidemic, but that all its predecessors had been
imported from some foreign country was not only anxiously
supported by the unanimous voice of the civil community,
but it was with equal unanimity believed that a
different doctrine would be fatal to the commercial prosperity
of the place. From this feeling of self-interest it is
to be admitted that the <i>military</i> were exempt, a distinction
between the two classes which ought to be taken into account
in estimating the value of the evidence taken by the
Board, and more especially the evidence of the medical
practitioners.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The <i>second</i> cause operating injuriously upon this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>inquiry was the publication, in the official government
newspaper (into which nothing is admitted except by
official authority), on January 12, 1829, of an article authoritatively
announcing that the late epidemic had been
imported into Gibraltar, and denouncing as void of common
sense any person who should hold a different opinion.
This official notification of the feelings of the local Government
(preceding as it did by only 12 days the appointment
of the Board of Inquiry) could hardly fail to encourage
evidence on one side, and discourage evidence on the
other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Complaints were also made that there was a partial
selection of witnesses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It always appeared most extraordinary and ‘unjustifiable,’”
says Dr Gillkrest, “that on this kind of inquiry,
which was intended by the Secretary of State to be so
beneficial to the interests of humanity, the Superintendent
of Quarantine, as president, should have assumed the right
in several instances of selecting the witnesses, which
obviously prejudiced the question, and by which much of
the truth was intercepted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Several medical officers of the garrison who had much
experience respecting the progress of the epidemic, were
either not examined at all, or only in a very imperfect
manner. I was among the latter, being surgeon to the
43rd Regiment, and present during the whole epidemic.
After a very limited examination, I officially informed the
President, by letter, that I had much to state; but, like
others, I was not called afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>“From what I felt due to the service of which I had
been a member for so many years, as well as the cause of
truth, I was induced to protest against such proceedings,
which protest will, I presume, be found with the documents
connected with the inquiry forwarded from Gibraltar
to the Colonial Office in London.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Complaints were further made of the mode of collecting
the evidence adopted on this occasion, which was such as
to excite the suspicion of some of the members of the
Commission, and to lead eventually to their condemnation
of it, and their repudiation of the Report which was founded
upon it.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c005'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>A return of the Sanitary Works carried out in those towns
to which the Public Health Act has been applied, was laid on
the table of the House of Commons, on the 12th of April last,
and ordered to be printed (No. 176, Session 1866). In view of
the threatened Epidemic, however, the unusual labour cast upon
the Local Government Office,—now charged with the superintendence
of Local Boards of Health,—must render it improbable
that time can be found to examine the proof of this
important return before the end of the Session.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this still early period in the progress of Sanitary Reform,
any such return must be manifestly imperfect; yet it will
probably be found that ten times the sum mentioned in the
text<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c005'><sup>[39]</sup></a> is already known to have been expended on these works;
and previous returns show that about a million and a half sterling
has, in addition, been laid out in the provision of Extramural
Cemeteries.</p>

<div class='footnote c006' id='f39'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See p. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The effect of these measures, in reducing the mortality of the
population, cannot of course be calculated at present with any
degree of accuracy; because no statistics of this nature can be
reliable, unless based upon an average of many years. It will,
nevertheless, be exceedingly interesting to watch the results of
these improvements in the civilization of England; improvements
which have been, perhaps, mainly effected by the labours
of Dr Southwood Smith.</p>

<p class='c008'>That such Sanitary appliances are not yet all that could be
wished in many of our larger towns, is abundantly exhibited by
the following extract from the Quarterly Report of the Registrar-General
for January, February, and March, 1866.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the map of England were shaded to represent the rates of
mortality of last quarter in the registration districts, the
eye, travelling from the lighter south to the darker north, would
be instantly drawn to a spot of portentous darkness on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Mersey; and the question would be asked whether cholera, the
black death, or other plague, imported with bales of merchandise,
had been lately introduced into its busy and populous seaport.
Happily this has not been the case; but fever, probably developed
or aided by the mild and damp atmosphere of the
season, and by overcrowding in an increasing population, has
been busy and fatal in Liverpool, and in other towns of the same
county and of Yorkshire. The annual mortality of the borough
of Liverpool in the three months was excessive, and demands
immediate and earnest consideration; it rose to 4.593 per cent.
This implies that if this death-rate were maintained for a year,
46 persons out of 1000 in the population would die in that
time, or 15 more than died in Glasgow, its northern rival,
19 more than in London. The mortality in the city of Manchester,
though far less than that of Liverpool, was higher than
in any other of the 13 selected towns of the United Kingdom;
it was 3.742 per cent.; and that of Leeds was hardly less.”</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
